  abstract = {Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (865–925 CE, 251–313 AH)was one of the greatest figures in the history of medicine in theIslamic tradition, and one of its most controversial philosophers.While we have ample surviving evidence for his medical thought, hisphilosophical ideas mostly have to be pieced together on the basis ofreports found in other authors, who are often hostile to him. Thisconcerns especially his notorious critique of religion, and histeaching that the cosmos is produced through the interaction of five“eternal principles”, namely God, Soul, matter, time, andplace. We do however have direct access to one branch of hisphilosophy, namely ethics, represented by a work of advice calledThe Spiritual Medicine and a briefer rejoinder to hiscritics, The Philosophical Way of Life. (Note that AbūBakr is not to be confused with other philosophers from the same cityof Rayy, who are also called al-Rāzī: the most famous ofthese is Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, who wrote severalcenturies later.)},

  abstract = {This book introduces readers to Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (known as Rhazes in Latin), one of the most innovative and divisive figures of the early philosophical tradition in the Islamic world. It attempts to reconstruct his notorious theory of “five eternals” which posited four principles alongside God for the creation of the world, which led Razi to be charged with heresy by other authors. Central to the interpretation of this theory is Razi’s concern with theodicy, and his idea that Platonist physics is more fundamental than Aristotelian physics. Other topics discussed in depth include his critical reaction to contemporary Islamic theology, his medical works, his alchemical theories, his works on ethics, and his controversial views on religion and prophecy.},

Major figures like Avicenna, Averroes, and Maimonides are covered in great detail, but the book also looks at less familiar thinkers, including women philosophers. Attention is also given to the philosophical relevance of Islamic theology (kalam) and mysticism--the Sufi tradition within Islam, and Kabbalah among Jews--and to science, with chapters on disciplines like optics and astronomy},

In each case the discussion unfolds not as advocacy of Platonic doctrines but as critical assessment of argument, and is meant as judicious explication of the logical form of significant theses often believed, during centuries of Platonic commentary, to be cornerstones of a monumental speculative system. It demonstrates a shared and strikingly high regard for Plato as a major thinker in the western philosophical tradition, a recognition that the dialogues he wrote continue to exert influence as well as attract theoretical attention.Taken together with the material on Plato in Volume II, Volume III displays a definite continuity in direction, scope, and quality, strengthening the conviction that Platonic scholarship has entered a new and different phase and has consolidated the approach that this new movement introduced.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents a general theoretical framework of human memory and describes the results of a number of experiments designed to test specific models that can be derived from the overall theory. This general theoretical framework categorizes the memory system along two major dimensions. The first categorization distinguishes permanent, structural features of the system from control processes that can be readily modified or reprogrammed at the will of the subject. The second categorization divides memory into three structural components: the sensory register, the short-term store, and the long-term store. Incoming sensory information first enters the sensory register, where it resides for a very brief period of time, then decays and is lost. The short-term store is the subject's working memory; it receives selected inputs from the sensory register and also from long-term store. The chapter also discusses the control processes associated with the sensory register. The term control process refers to those processes that are not permanent features of memory, but are instead transient phenomena under the control of the subject; their appearance depends on several factors such as instructional set, the experimental task, and the past history of the subject.},

(1992). At study, subjects were exposed to four lists of words. Following list presentation, subjects were presented with three-letter word stems under four conditions: (1) silent viewing, (2) completion of word stems that could not form words from the study list, with the instruction to provide the first word that came to mind (baseline), (3) completion of word stems, half of which could form words from the study list, with the instruction to provide the first word that came to mind (priming), and (4) completion of word stems, half of which could form words from the study list, with the instruction to use the stems as cues for recall of list words (memory). The behavioral data indicated an agerelated deficit in cued recall that was reduced in priming. Both age groups showed a similar decrease of blood flow in right posterior cortex during priming relative to baseline. During cued recall, bilateral increases of blood flow were observed in prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus for both age groups. The young adults showed selective increases of activity in left cerebellum and Wernicke's area, whereas the older adults showed a selective bilateral activation in the perirhinal region of the medial-temporal cortex during cued recall. The results suggest a simiiar biological basis of priming in both age groups: a decrease in the neural activity required to process a particular stimulus during a subsequent encounter compared with a previous one. In addition, the importance of prefrontal regions for conscious retrieval was substantiated and extended to late adulthood. Finally, the agedifferential activations observed during cued recall were discussed relative to prominent concepts in the current literature on cognitive aging (e.g., speed of processing, self-initiated operations, cross-modal recoding).},

Both arecharacters in Platonic dialogues, in the Gorgias and Book Iof the Republic respectively; both denounce the virtue ofjustice, dikaiosunê, as an artificial brake onself-interest, a fraud to be seen through by intelligent people.Together, Thrasymachus and Callicles have fallen into the folkmythology of moral philosophy as ‘the immoralist’ (or‘amoralist’). These are perhaps not quite the right words,but it is useful to have a label for their common challenge—more generally, for the figure who demands a good reason to abide bymoral constraints, and denies, implicitly or explicitly, that thisdemand can be met.[1] Because of this shared agenda, and because Socrates’ refutationof Callicles can be read as an unsatisfying rehearsal for theRepublic, it is tempting to assume that the two share asingle philosophical position. But in fact Callicles and Thrasymachusare by no means interchangeable; and the differences between them areimportant both for the interpretation of Plato and philosophically,for our understanding of the varieties of immoralism and themotivations behind it. This article discusses both the commonchallenge presented by these two figures and the features whichseparate them, treating them strictly as players in Plato’sphilosophical dramas. (Thrasymachus was a real person, a famousdiplomat and orator of whose real views we know only a little; ofCallicles we know nothing, and he may even be Plato’s invention.)[2] It will also compare them to a third Platonic version of theimmoralist challenge, the one presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus inRepublic Book II, and to the writings of sophist Antiphon—the best-known real-life counterpart of all three Platonicviews, and perhaps their historical original. Certain aspects ofPlato’s own arguments against immoralism will also be discussed,insofar as they help to clarify what Callicles and Thrasymachusthemselves have to say.},

  abstract = {The dialogue begins with Meno's peremptory request: ‘Can you tell me, Socrates, whether virtue can be taught, or is it acquired by practice, not teaching …?’ (70a). Socrates protests that he does not know what virtue is, and hence cannot know whether it is teachable or not, explaining that in general if one does not know what a thing is,               τί ἐστι               , one cannot know what it is like,               ὁποῖον               (71b). He insists that the prior question of what virtue is must be settled before consideration of the subsequent question of whether it is teachable or not.                                         In accordance with this principle, Socrates gets Meno to make attempts to offer a general definition of virtue. As in earlier dialogues, Socrates quickly reduces his interlocutor to               aporia               , and Meno refuses to make further attempts at defining virtue on the ground that no criterion of truth exists. Socrates sums up his argument thus: ‘It is impossible for a man to enquire into what he knows or into what he does not know. For he cannot enquire into what he knows, because he knows it, and there is no need for enquiry; nor again can he enquire into what he does not know, since he does not know about what he is to enquire into’ (80e). Socrates describes this paradox as a piece of eristic, but he does not dismiss it. To resolve it, he introduces the theory of recollection,               ἀνάμησιρ               (81a–e).},

  abstract = {1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane.2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10-20/sec for 10-15 sec, or 100/sec for 3-4 sec.3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells.4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments.5. During conditioning at 10-20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (;frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation.6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In Platonic dialogues the author’s reflections and intention are to be found not only in the statements of particular characters, but in the arrangement of the text as a whole. Not only does Plato decide what his main character says but he also chooses the reactions of his interlocutors, the progress and results of the conversation and whether his characters consider these results to be final answers. It seems that a Platonic dialogue could tell his reader more than what the interlocutors tell each other.                            In my paper I try to reconstruct from discernible phenomena what the               Meno               is intended to tell us. My starting point is the question how the topics of this dialogue are connected with each other. Why did Plato present the question whether ἀρετή is teachable, the theory of recollection, the method of hypothesis and the distinction between knowledge and opinion in the same dialogue? Is the               Meno               to be considered as a collection of philosophical topics independent of each other, or did Plato see an interconnection between them? And how could this interconnection be described?},

  abstract = {M. F. Burnyeat taught for 14 years in the Philosophy Department of University College London, then for 18 years in the Classics Faculty at Cambridge, 12 of them as the Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy, before migrating to Oxford in 1996 to become a Senior Research Fellow in Philosophy at All Souls College. The studies, articles and reviews collected in these two volumes of Explorations in Ancient and Modern Philosophy were all written, and all but two published, before that decisive change. Whether designed for a scholarly audience or for a wider public, they range from the Presocratics to Augustine, from Descartes and Bishop Berkeley to Wittgenstein and G. E. Moore. Their subject-matter falls under four main headings: 'Logic and Dialectic' and 'Scepticism Ancient and Modern', which make up the first volume, with 'Knowledge' and 'Philosophy and the Good Life' contained in this, the second volume. The title 'Explorations' well expresses Burnyeat's ability to discover new aspects of familiar texts, new ways of solving old problems. In his hands the history of philosophy becomes itself a philosophical activity.},

  abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to compare regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in young (mean 26 years) and old (mean 70 years) subjects while they were encoding, recognizing, and recalling word pairs. A multivariate partial-least-squares (PLS) analysis of the data was used to identify age-related neural changes associated with (1) encoding versus retrieval and (2) recognition versus recall. Young subjects showed higher activation than old subjects (1) in left prefrontal and occipito-temporal regions during encoding and (2) in right prefrontal and parietal regions during retrieval. Old subjects showed relatively higher activation than young subjects in several regions, including insular regions during encoding, cuneus/precuneus regions during recognition, and left prefrontal regions during recall. Frontal activity in young subjects was left-lateralized during encoding and right-lateralized during recall [hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry (HERA)], whereas old adults showed little frontal activity during encoding and a more bilateral pattern of frontal activation during retrieval. In young subjects, activation in recall was higher than that in recognition in cerebellar and cingulate regions, whereas recognition showed higher activity in right temporal and parietal regions. In old subjects, the differences in blood flow between recall and recognition were smaller in these regions, yet more pronounced in other regions. Taken together, the results indicate that advanced age is associated with neural changes in the brain systems underlying encoding, recognition, and recall. These changes take two forms: (1) age-related decreases in local regional activity, which may signal less efficient processing by the old, and (2) age-related increases in activity, which may signal functional compensation.},

  abstract = {In this paper I re-examine the status of the mind-body relation in several of Plato’s late dialogues. A range of views has been attributed to Plato here. For example, it has been thought that Plato is a substance dualist, for whom the mind can exist independently of the body; or an attribute dualist, who has left behind the strong dualistic commitments of the Phaedo by allowing that the mind may be the subject of spatial movements. But even in cases where a classification of Plato as a holder of a particular ontology of the mind has been left undefined, it has been a shared assumption that in the late dialogues the mind itself must be immaterial. I take issue with these various views and show that none of them is necessitated by the text. In the first place, I argue there is strong evidence against the view that Plato should, in his late period, be committed not only to substance dualism, but also to attribute dualism. Furthermore, it is possible that Plato may have allowed that the mind itself be a three-dimensional corporeal entity (in a way that sets up a precedent for later Stoic developments). But even if this is not the only possible reading of the text, it is shown how at any rate the mind must be seen in late Plato as the principle of organization of a body and ontologically inseparable from it. Despite prima facie affinities with Aristotle here, we shall see a Plato emerge for whom the mind (without exception) and the body cannot exist without one another – a thesis more radical than that of Aristotle’s. To bring out the provocative nature of this suggestion, I start, in section I, by laying out the state of the question and compare what I shall argue is the late Platonic view with standard interpretations of his previous work, stressing the historical force that I expect this thesis to have. Afterwards, in three respective sections, I proceed to pay heed to relevant passages in the Timaeus , Philebus and Laws in order to establish the main point of this paper. Finally, in section V, I consider the challenge apparently introduced against my thesis by Plato’s occasional talk of immortality and eschatology in those dialogues, and argue instead that many of those passages add further strength to the view defended in this essay.},

  abstract = {This new examination of the Republic begins with questions ignored by most students of this famous and much-studied dialogue. Why is Plato's most extensive portrait of philosophy pervaded with the language and imagery of war? Why is a discussion supposedly about justice almost entirely about how to educate natural warriors? Why must the philosopher-kings of Kallipolis be first of all 'champions of war'? Why is the supposedly 'feminine drama' of Book Five preoccupied with war? The pursuit of questions such as these brings Craig to an understanding of Plato's teaching about justice, philosophy, and politics that differs radically from what is generally held today.The search for why the Republic's philosophers come from the ranks of 'war lovers' leads Craig to reassess the relation between the `city in logos' and timocracy (the regime openly dedicated to war), and this reassessment in turn brings a new perspective on Plato's political thought in general. Similarly, analysis of the timocratic man leads to a deeper understanding of the psychology on which the whole dialogue is based, especially its teaching about justice and its treatment of love. Following the dialogue's hint that language provides the `tracks' of ideas, Craig compares the four distinct kinds of love that figure in the dialogue, and thereby helps clarify several puzzling issues, not the least of which is the strange kinship between the philosopher and the tyrant. And through examining the peculiar problems posed by what he argues are two distinct kinds of timocrats - exemplified by Glaukon and Adeimantos - Craig illuminates the rationale underlying both educational schemes sketched in the dialogue: the political one of Books Two and Three and the pre-philosophical one of Book Seven. One chapter explores the analogical and allegorical dimensions of Book Five, as well as its actual political implications; there Craig offers clarification of the contemporary debate about sex roles. In bringing the Republic vividly to life, Craig shows that Plato's ideas on virtually all questions of permanent interest to human beings provide a corrective to views now in vogue. The War Lover is thus as much a commentary on contemporary intellectual and political life as it is a challenging new interpretation of an ancient text.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This volume collects Davidson's seminal contributions to the philosophy of language. Its key insight is that the concept of truth can shed light on various issues connected to meaning: Davidson, who assumes a partial and primitive understanding of the truth predicate, reverses Tarski who had succeeded in elucidating the concept of truth by taking the notion of ‘translation’ (preservation of meaning) for granted. In the first of five subsections into which the papers are thematically organized, Davidson develops the systematic constraints a theory of meaning has to meet and shows how an approach to semantics based on the concept of truth meets these demands better than any rival approach. Sect. 2 explores whether one can give semantic analyses of quotation, intensional contexts, and force within the extensional limitations of the truth‐theoretic framework. Viewing the theories of meaning developed in the first section as empirical, Sect. 3 inquires into their testability: can we verify these theories without presupposing concepts too closely aligned to that of meaning, interpretation, and synonymy? Davidson develops constitutive constraints on applying truth theories to interpret the speech behaviour of others: we have to view utterances for the most part as assertions of the speaker's beliefs and those beliefs as largely true and consistent (he terms this the ‘Principle of Charity’). Sect. 4 combines these interpretative constraints with the semantic concept of truth developed in Sect. 1 to tackle metaphysical issues. Davidson claims that truth is not relative to conceptual schemes but only to languages that can be shown to be largely correct about the world; consequently, by studying those languages via the semantic concept of truth we can derive ontological conclusions. Sect. 5 explores aspects of linguistic usage that form a particular threat to theories of meaning (such as Davidson's) that focus on the literal meaning of sentences: for truth theory to be adequate as a general theory of language, it must give valid accounts of sentence mood, illocutionary force, and metaphorical meaning.},

It is argued that, at least by ordinary standards for knowledge, we do know that skeptical hypotheses are false, and that we’ve lost the lottery (unless one is in fact the winner of the lottery, in which case one does not know that one has lost, but is reasonable in thinking that one knows it). Accounting for how it is that we know that skeptical hypotheses are false and why it seems that we don’t know that they’re false tells us a lot, both about what knowledge is and how knowledge attributions work. Along the way, the following are all carefully explained and defended: Moorean methodological approaches to skepticism, on which one seeks to defeat, rather than refute, the skeptic; contextualist responses to skepticism; contextualist substantive Mooreanism; the basic safety approach to knowledge and the double-safety picture of what knowledge is; insensitivity accounts of various appearances of ignorance; the closure principle for knowledge; and the claim that our knowledge that we are not brains in vats is a priori, despite its being knowledge of a deeply contingent fact.},

Consolidation during sleep promotes both quantitative and qualitative changes of memory representations. Through specific patterns of neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep support system consolidation and synaptic consolidation, respectively. During SWS, slow oscillations, spindles and ripples - at minimum cholinergic activity - coordinate the re-activation and redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas during REM sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene activity - at high cholinergic and theta activity - might favour the subsequent synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex.},

I argue that although Thrasymachus does abandon a positivist conception of rulers and laws, this leaves his conventionalist understanding of justice in tact until his move to his more substantive statement of what justice is 343c. The discussion is intended to provide a more nuanced account of the incoherence in Thrasymachus’ various claims about justice, rulers, and laws.},

  abstract = {It has long been known that memory is not a single process. Rather, there are different kinds of memory that are supported by distinct neural systems. This idea stemmed from early findings of dissociable patterns of memory impairments in patients with selective damage to different brain regions. These studies highlighted the role of the basal ganglia in non-declarative memory, such as procedural or habit learning, contrasting it with the known role of the medial temporal lobes in declarative memory. In recent years, major advances across multiple areas of neuroscience have revealed an important role for the basal ganglia in motivation and decision making. These findings have led to new discoveries about the role of the basal ganglia in learning and highlighted the essential role of dopamine in specific forms of learning. Here we review these recent advances with an emphasis on novel discoveries from studies of learning in patients with Parkinson's disease. We discuss how these findings promote the development of current theories away from accounts that emphasize the verbalizability of the contents of memory and towards a focus on the specific computations carried out by distinct brain regions. Finally, we discuss new challenges that arise in the face of accumulating evidence for dynamic and interconnected memory systems that jointly contribute to learning.},

  abstract = {Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutrient deficiency, affecting 2 billion people and 30\% of pregnant women and their offspring. Early life ID affects at least 3 major neurobehavioral domains, including speed of processing, affect, and learning and memory, the latter being particularly prominent. The learning and memory deficits occur while the infants are iron deficient and persist despite iron repletion. The neural mechanisms underlying the short- and long-term deficits are being elucidated. Early ID alters the transcriptome, metabolome, structure, intracellular signaling pathways, and electrophysiology of the developing hippocampus, the brain region responsible for recognition learning and memory. Until recently, it was unclear whether these effects are directly due to a lack of iron interacting with important transcriptional, translational, or posttranslational processes or to indirect effects such as hypoxia due to anemia or stress. Nonanemic genetic mouse models generated by conditionally altering expression of iron transport proteins specifically in hippocampal neurons in late gestation have led to a greater understanding of iron’s role in learning and memory. The learning deficits in adulthood likely result from interactions between direct and indirect effects that contribute to abnormal hippocampal structure and plasticity. Adv. Nutr. 2: 112–121, 2011.},

  abstract = {The prefrontal cortex is essential for the temporal integration of sensory information in behavioural and linguistic sequences. Such information is commonly encoded in more than one sense modality, notably sight and sound. Connections from sensory cortices to the prefrontal cortex support its integrative function. Here we present the first evidence that prefrontal cortex cells associate visual and auditory stimuli across time. We gave monkeys the task of remembering a tone of a certain pitch for 10 s and then choosing the colour associated with it. In this task, prefrontal cortex cells responded selectively to tones, and most of them also responded to colours according to the task rule. Thus, their reaction to a tone was correlated with their subsequent reaction to the associated colour. This correlation faltered in trials ending in behavioural error. We conclude that prefrontal cortex neurons are part of integrative networks that represent behaviourally meaningful cross-modal associations. The orderly and timely activation of neurons in such networks is crucial for the temporal transfer of information in the structuring of behaviour, reasoning and language.},

  abstract = {How is it that words (such as “Aristotle”) come to stand for the things they stand for (such as Aristotle)? Is the thing that a word stands for, its reference, fully identified or described by conventions known to the users of the word? Or is there a more roundabout relation between the reference of a word and the conventions that determine or fix it? Do words like “water,” “three,” and “red” refer to appropriate things, just as the word “Aristotle” refers to Aristotle? If so, which things are these, and how do they come to be referred to by those words? In               Roads to Reference               , Mario Gómez-Torrente provides novel answers to these and other questions that have been of traditional interest in the theory of reference. The book introduces a number of cases of apparent indeterminacy of reference for proper names, demonstratives, and natural kind terms, which suggest that reference-fixing conventions for them adopt the form of lists of merely sufficient conditions for reference and reference failure. Arguments are then provided for a new anti-descriptivist picture of those kinds of words, according to which the reference-fixing conventions for them do not describe their reference. The book also defends realist and objectivist accounts of the reference of ordinary natural kind nouns, numerals, and adjectives for sensible qualities. According to these accounts, these words refer, respectively, to “ordinary kinds,” cardinality properties, and properties of membership in intervals of sensible dimensions, and these things are fixed in subtle ways by associated reference-fixing conventions.},

  abstract = {Although granule cells continue to be added to the dentate gyrus of adult rats and tree shrews, this phenomenon has not been demonstrated in the dentate gyrus of adult primates. To determine whether neurons are produced in the dentate gyrus of adult primates, adult marmoset monkeys (               Callithrix jacchus               ) were injected with BrdU and perfused 2 hr or 3 weeks later. BrdU is a thymidine analog that is incorporated into proliferating cells during S phase. A substantial number of cells in the dentate gyrus of adult monkeys incorporated BrdU and ≈80\% of these cells had morphological characteristics of granule neurons and expressed a neuronal marker by the 3-week time point. Previous studies suggest that the proliferation of granule cell precursors in the adult dentate gyrus can be inhibited by stress in rats and tree shrews. To test whether an aversive experience has a similar effect on cell proliferation in the primate brain, adult marmoset monkeys were exposed to a resident-intruder model of stress. After 1 hr in this condition, the intruder monkeys were injected with BrdU and perfused 2 hr later. The number of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus of the intruder monkeys was compared with that of unstressed control monkeys. We found that a single exposure to this stressful experience resulted in a significant reduction in the number of these proliferating cells. Our results suggest that neurons are produced in the dentate gyrus of adult monkeys and that the rate of precursor cell proliferation can be affected by a stressful experience.},

How NMN is taken up into cells has not been entirely clear. Here we show that the Slc12a8 gene encodes a specific NMN transporter. We find that Slc12a8 is highly expressed and regulated by NAD+ in the mouse small intestine. Slc12a8 knockdown abrogates the uptake of NMN in vitro and in vivo. We further show that Slc12a8 specifically transports NMN, but not nicotinamide riboside, and that NMN transport depends on the presence of sodium ion. Slc12a8 deficiency significantly decreases NAD+ levels in the jejunum and ileum, which is associated with reduced NMN uptake as traced by doubly labelled isotopic NMN. Finally, we observe that Slc12a8 expression is upregulated in the aged mouse ileum, which contributes to the maintenance of ileal NAD+ levels. Our work identifies a specific NMN transporter and demonstrates that Slc12a8 has a critical role in regulating intestinal NAD+ metabolism.},

  abstract = {Structural equations have become increasingly popular in recent years as tools for understanding causation. But standard structural equations approaches to causation face deep problems. The most philosophically interesting of these consists in their failure to incorporate a distinction between default states of an object or system, and deviations therefrom. Exploring this problem, and how to fix it, helps to illuminate the central role this distinction plays in our causal thinking.},

Althoughthe Sinograph “chan” (禪) transliterates theSanskrit dhyāna or “meditation”, andChan zong can thus be translated as the “MeditationSchool”, Chan was not distinctive within Chinese Buddhism in itsuse of meditative techniques. What distinguished Chan were its noveluse of language, its development of new narrative forms, and itsvalorization of the direct and embodied realization of Buddhistawakening. In contrast with the epistemic, hermeneutical andmetaphysical concerns that shaped other schools of Chinese Buddhism,Chan’s defining concerns were experiential andrelational—concerns that fit most comfortably, perhaps, withinthe horizons of philosophical anthropology. Appreciating thephilosophical dimensions of Chan thus requires some familiarity withBuddhist thought and practice, and the dynamics of their infusion intoChinese culture.},

Amongst the many themes that come into focus are: the model status of ancient medicine in defining the political art, the similarities between the Platonic and Aristotelian conceptions of technê, the use of technê as a paradigm for virtue and practical rationality, technê's determining role in Platonic conceptions of cosmology, technê's relationship to experience and theoretical knowledge, virtue as an 'art of living', the adaptability of the criteria of technê to suit different skills, including philosophy itself, the use in productive knowledge of models, deliberation, conjecture and imagination"--},

  abstract = {Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, or Deaths of Eminent Men and History of the Sons of the Epoch, was the noted Arabic scholar Ibn Khallikan's most well-known and respected work. The author worked on the tome from 1256 to 1274, compiling names, genealogies, and histories of prominent or conspicuous men in the Islamic world. The final work was translated into English by William MacGuckin de Slane and is longer than 2,700 pages. It has been quoted by many Arabic rhetoricians and grammarians in other works, as it is considered one of the most important records of Arabic history ever written. Here, separated into four volumes, the Biographical Dictionary is an essential work for any student of Muslim culture and literature. Volume III includes: A detailed index of all biographies; notes from the translator for each biography; and genealogies of hundreds of Muslim figures, including The Katib Imad Ad-Din Al-Ispahani, Abu Bakr Al-Khowarezmi, Mukhlis Ad-Dawla Mukallad, and Nasr Al-Khubzaruzzi. IBN KHALLIKAN (1211-1282) was a thirteenth century Arabic scholar who studied in Damascus, Mosul and Aleppo, specializing in the fields of language, theology, and law, including jurisprudence. He became a well-respected judge in Cairo, eventually becoming a chief judge in Damascus in 1261. Khallikan wrote several books, but his most well known was Deaths of Eminent Men and History of the Sons of the Epoch, often referred to as the "Biographical Dictionary," which took him almost 20 years to complete. Khallikan retired from his position as judge just before his death in 1282. He was one of the most well-known historians and theologians in Egypt.},

This view depends upon three positions: 1) that Plato invites us to interpret the relationship between techne and polis outside the terms of the city-soul analogy, 2) that the strict account contributes to a compelling description of vocational work, and 3) that this description determines what Socrates means by a true polis, and thus frames the problem of philosophy’s political inclusion.},

Our findings elucidate the value of spiritual and religious identities to gaining commitment, warn of the perils of preaching to the unconverted, and highlight movements that seek to transform the ideology and culture of consumerism. Conceiving mainstream consumers as ideological opponents inverts conventional NSM theories that view them as activists’ clients.},

  abstract = {The neural mechanisms of emotion and memory have long been thought to reside side by side, if not in overlapping structures, of the limbic system. However, the limbic system concept is no longer acceptable as an account of the neural basis of memory or emotion and is being replaced with specific circuit accounts of specific emotional and memory processes. Emotional memory, a special category of memory involving the implicit (probably unconscious) learning and storage of information about the emotional significance of events, is modeled in rodent experiments using aversive classical conditioning techniques. The neural system underlying emotional memory critically involves the amygdala and structures with which it is connected. Afferent inputs from sensory processing areas of the thalamus and cortex mediate emotional learning in situations involving specific sensory cues, whereas learning about the emotional significance of more general, contextual cues involves projections to the amygdala from the hippocampal formation. Within the amygdala, the lateral nucleus (AL) is the sensory interface and the central nucleus the linkage with motor systems involved in the control of species-typical emotional behaviors and autonomic responses. Studies of cellular mechanisms in these pathways have focused on the direct relay to the lateral amygdala from the auditory thalamus. These studies show that single cells in AL respond to both conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus inputs, leading to the notion that AL might be a critical site of sensory-sensory integration in emotional learning. The thalamo-amygdala pathway also exhibits long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity that might underlie the emotional learning functions of the circuit. The thalamo-amygdala pathway contains and uses the amino acid glutamate in synaptic transmission, suggesting the possibility that an amino-acid mediated form of synaptic plasticity is involved in the emotional learning functions of the pathway. We are thus well on the way to a systems level and a cellular understanding of at least one form of emotional learning and memory.},

Part III, Pragmatics and Speech Acts, introduces the basic concepts of linguistic pragmatics and includes a detailed discussion of the problem of indirect force.

The dramatic situation in Book I presents justice as internal, requiring not laws, but discrimination and virtue.  After this introduction, the rest of the Republic serves to sketch out what virtue is and how to practice discrimination. Plato on Justice and Power ends with some illuminating contrasts between this sense of virtue and that characteristic of our modern liberal politics which takes an external view of justice similar to the Athenians view at the time of Plato.},

Thiamine is a helper molecule (i.e., a cofactor) required by three enzymes involved in two pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. Because intermediate products of these pathways are needed for the generation of other essential molecules in the cells (e.g., building blocks of proteins and DNA as well as brain chemicals), a reduction in thiamine can interfere with numerous cellular functions, leading to serious brain disorders, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is found predominantly in alcoholics. Chronic alcohol consumption can result in thiamine deficiency by causing inadequate nutritional thiamine intake, decreased absorption of thiamine from the gastrointestinal tract, and impaired thiamine utilization in the cells. People differ in their susceptibility to thiamine deficiency, however, and different brain regions also may be more or less sensitive to this condition.},

Evidence obtained in patients with late-onset amnesia resulting from medial temporal pathology has given rise to two opposing interpretations of the effects of such damage on long-term cognitive memory. One view is that cognitive memory, including memory for both facts and events, is served in a unitary manner by the hippocampus and its surrounding cortices; the other is that the basic function affected in amnesia is event memory, the memory for factual material often showing substantial preservation. Recent findings in patients with amnesia resulting from relatively selective hippocampal damage sustained early in life suggest a possible reconciliation of the two views. The new findings suggest that the hippocampus may be especially important for event as opposed to fact memory, with the surrounding cortical areas contributing to both. Evidence from neuroanatomical and neurobehavioural studies in monkeys is presented in support of this proposal.},

In what follows, Socrates offers a number of arguments directed against Thrasymachus’ views concerning the nature of skill, ruling, and justice. However, both Thrasymachus’ views and Socrates’ arguments against Thrasymachus’ views have frequently been misunderstood. In this paper, I clarify Thrasymachus’ views concerning the nature of skill and ability, reconstruct Socrates’ arguments against Thrasymachus’ views concerning skill and justice, and argue that Socrates’ arguments are better than often supposed.},

This framework explains why the brain requires two differentially specialized learning and memory systems, and it nicely specifies their central properties (i.e., the hippocampus as a sparse, pattern-separated system for rapidly learning episodic memories, and the neocortex as a distributed, overlapping system for gradually integrating across episodes to extract latent semantic structure). We review the application of the CLS framework to a range of important topics, including the following: the basic neural processes of hippocampal memory encoding and recall, conjunctive encoding, human recognition memory, consolidation of initial hippocampal learning in cortex, dynamic modulation of encoding versus recall, and the synergistic interactions between hippocampus and neocortex. Overall, the CLS framework remains a vital theoretical force in the field, with the empirical data over the past 15 years generally confirming its key principles.},

Because the interpretive essays both sketch the general outlines of the dialogues and take up specific theoretical or philosophic difficulties, they will be of interest not only to those reading the dialogues for the first time but also to those already familiar with them.The Protagoras and the Meno are linked by the attention each pays to the idea of virtue: the latter dialogue focuses on the fundamental Socratic question, "What is virtue?"; the former on the specific virtue of courage, especially in its relation to wisdom.An appendix contains a short extract from Xenophon's Anabasis of Cyrus that vividly portrays the figure of Meno.},

  abstract = {Social media posts incorporate real-time information that has, elsewhere, been exploited to predict social trends. This paper considers whether such information can be useful in relation to crime and fear of crime. A large number of tweets were collected from the 18 largest Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, over a period of 70 days. These tweets are then classified as being crime-related or not and additional information is extracted, including the type of crime and where possible, any geo-location at a city level. From the analysis of collected data, it is established that around 15 out of every 1000 tweets have text related to a crime, or fear of crime. The frequency of tweets related to crime is then compared against the number of murders, the murder rate, or the level of fear of crime as recorded in surveys. Results show that, like mass media, such as newspapers, social media suffer from a strong bias towards violent or sexual crimes. Furthermore, social media messages are not highly correlated with crime. Thus, social media is shown not to be highly useful for detecting trends in crime itself, but what they do demonstrate is rather a reflection of the level of the fear of crime.},

  abstract = {According to common practice and oral tradition, learning verbal materials through song should facilitate word recall. In the present study, we provide evidence against this belief. In Experiment 1, 36 university students, half of them musicians, learned an unfamiliar song in three conditions. In the sung-sung condition, the song to be learned was sung, and the response was sung too. In the sung-spoken condition, the response was spoken. In the divided-spoken condition, the presented lyrics (accompanied by music) and the response were both spoken. Superior word recall in the sung-sung condition was predicted. However, fewer words were recalled when singing than when speaking. Furthermore, the mode of presentation, whether sung or spoken, had no influence on lyric recall, in either short- or long-term recall. In Experiment 2, singing was assessed with and without words. Altogether, the results indicate that the text and the melody of a song have separate representations in memory, making singing a dual task to perform, at least in the first steps of learning. Interestingly, musical training had little impact on performance, suggesting that vocal learning is a basic and widespread skill.},

  abstract = {Memory systems research has typically described the different types of long-term memory in the brain as either declarative versus non-declarative or implicit versus explicit. These descriptions reflect the difference between declarative, conscious, and explicit memory that is dependent on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system, and all other expressions of learning and memory. The other type of memory is generally defined by an absence: either the lack of dependence on the MTL memory system (nondeclarative) or the lack of conscious awareness of the information acquired (implicit). However, definition by absence is inherently underspecified and leaves open questions of how this type of memory operates, its neural basis, and how it differs from explicit, declarative memory. Drawing on a variety of studies of implicit learning that have attempted to identify the neural correlates of implicit learning using functional neuroimaging and neuropsychology, a theory of implicit memory is presented that describes it as a form of general plasticity within processing networks that adaptively improve function via experience. Under this model, implicit memory will not appear as a single, coherent, alternative memory system but will instead be manifested as a principle of improvement from experience based on widespread mechanisms of cortical plasticity. The implications of this characterization for understanding the role of implicit learning in complex cognitive processes and the effects of interactions between types of memory will be discussed for examples within and outside the psychology laboratory.},

The impact of school-based music programs on memory processes is however relatively unknown. The current study explored the effect of increasing frequency and intensity of classroom-based instrumental training program on verbal and visual memory across a two year period. Data from 142 participants were analysed: 82 (41 female (F), 41 male (M); mean age 8.62 years) allocated to the intensive strings music training program and 68 (37F, 31M; mean age 8.79 years) allocated to the control group (usual music classes). The Children’s Memory Scale was used to test digit span, verbal learning and immediate and delayed verbal memory. Immediate visual recall was tested using the Benton Visual Designs test. Mixed model ANOVAs revealed that students receiving the intensive music training program exhibited significantly better learning and immediate recall for verbal information, after approximately one year, but not two years, after implementation of the program than did controls. No such benefit was observed following one year of a similarly novel juggling program in a sub-set of the sample. As anticipated, the intensive music training had no effect on visual memory, although an improvement in visual perceptual ability and digit span recall was observed in the first year also. The current findings have implications for educational programs (such as literacy training) which may benefit from transient improvements in verbal memory.},

In general, the idea is that, for some particular domain,there are two fundamental kinds or categories of things orprinciples. In theology, for example a ‘dualist’ issomeone who believes that Good and Evil – or God and the Devil – are independent and more or less equal forces in theworld. Dualism contrasts with monism, which is the theory that thereis only one fundamental kind, category of thing or principle; and,rather less commonly, with pluralism, which is the view that there aremany kinds or categories.  In the philosophy of mind, dualism is thetheory that the mental and the physical – or mind and body ormind and brain – are, in some sense, radically different kindsof things. Because common sense tells us that there are physicalbodies, and because there is intellectual pressure towards producing aunified view of the world, one could say that materialist monism isthe ‘default option’. Discussion about dualism, therefore,tends to start from the assumption of the reality of the physicalworld, and then to consider arguments for why the mind cannot betreated as simply part of that world.},

We examined the genotype distribution of the BDKRB2 9/+9 polymorphic site in a group of Polish athletes and confi rmed the results obtained in a replication study of Russian athletes. Three hundred and two Polish athletes and 684 unrelated sedentary controls, as well as 822 Russian athletes and 507 unrelated sedentary volunteers, were recruited for this study. All samples were genotyped for the –9/+9 polymorphism within exon 1 of the BDKRB2 gene using polymerase chain reaction. Significance was assessed by chi square analysis with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple testing. We found no statistical difference in the –9/+9 genotype and allele frequencies in two groups of athletes divided into four subgroups: endurance, sprint‐endurance, sprint-strength, and strength athletes, compared with controls. There were no signifi cant differences in allele frequencies (p = 0.477) and genotype distribution (p = 0.278) in the initial and replication studies. Thus, no association was found between the BDKRB2 –9/+9 polymorphism and elite athletic status in two cohorts of eastern European athletes.}

R., Newport, E. L., \& Aslin, R. N. (1996). Word segmentation: The role of distributional cues.

They also showed that a similar learning mechanism operates with musical stimuli [Saffran, J. R., Johnson, R. E. K., Aslin, N., \& Newport, E. L. (1999). Abstract Statistical learning of tone sequences by human infants and adults. Cognition, 70, 27-52.]. In this work we combined linguistic and musical information and we compared language learning based on speech sequences to language learning based on sung sequences. We hypothesized that, compared to speech sequences, a consistent mapping of linguistic and musical information would enhance learning. Results confirmed the hypothesis showing a strong learning facilitation of song compared to speech. Most importantly, the present results show that learning a new language, especially in the first learning phase wherein one needs to segment new words, may largely benefit of the motivational and structuring properties of music in song.},

  abstract = {This paper examines Plato's ideas on cause-effect relations in the "Phaedo." It maintains that he sees causes as things (not events, states of affairs or the like), with any information as to how that thing brings about the effect relegated to a strictly secondary status. This is argued to make good sense, so long as we recognise that aition means the "thing responsible" and exploit legal analogies in order to understand what this amounts to. Furthermore, provided that we do not pre-suppose that we already know what can and what cannot count as a cause, Plato proves to have an attractive case for his principle that all causation is a matter of like causing like. Once we appreciate this, we are a little closer to understanding his more idiosyncratic principle, which although puzzling is ubiquitous in his writings and often invoked as a premise in key arguments, that opposites cannot cause opposites. The last part of the paper turns to formal causes, defending Plato's advocacy of them, and examining their role in the "Parmenides'" Third Man Argument. The main proposal is that Plato's conception of Forms as causes opens the door to a better version of that argument's "Non-identity" premise than those currently available.},

  abstract = {A green electrical energy source is suggested in this study to reduce carbon emissions for application in wearable flexible smart sensors/electronics/medical devices. Fish scales of Rohu fish are used to produce electricity by designing and fabricating triboelectric nanogenerators which need only human motion instead of a battery to produce electricity for self powered sensors and IoT devices. These fish scales are available in abundance in a fish market as a waste material globally. These scales are transparent, flexible, non-toxic, biodegradable, biocompatible, and cheaper (free of cost) material. A very simple design, fabrication, and operation technique is proposed in this study. The various characterization techniques SEM, EDX, FTIR, and XRD are performed on the fish scale because triboelectricity generation depends upon the material composition and surface morphology. The SEM results show a distinct surface pattern of the scale which is helpful for triboelectric charge generation. The EDX shows the basic elemental composition in which Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen are dominant. Further, the FTIR spectrum shows the presence of different bio proteins including keratin, collagens, chitin, etc. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that a fish scale-based fabricated device is capable of working under 2000 C. A comparative analysis of the triboelectric performance of fish scale with other already reported biomaterials eggshell membrane, dog hair, and Bombax ceiba tree cotton is also presented in this study along with highly tribonegative material PTFE. The results of this study help to estimate the position of the novel fish scale material in the triboelectric series. The electrical output of this fish scale-based device is used to light up 90 commercial green LEDs which is equivalent to 180~V. The current of value 1.7~µA has been measured across the 1~MΩ resistor. To present the potential application of the fabricated device, a digital calculator is Switch ON using electricity produced from the fish scale based device.},

This neural system consists of the hippocampus and adjacent, anatomically related cortex, including entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. These structures, presumably by virtue of their widespread and reciprocal connections with neocortex, are essential for establishing long-term memory for facts and events (declarative memory). The medial temporal lobe memory system is needed to bind together the distributed storage sites in neocortex that represent a whole memory. However, the role of this system is only temporary. As time passes after learning, memory stored in neocortex gradually becomes independent of medial temporal lobe structures.},

  abstract = {The City and Man consists of provocative essays by the late Leo Strauss on Aristotle's Politics, Plato's Republic, and Thucydides' Peloponnesian Wars. Together, the essays constitute a brilliant attempt to use classical political philosophy as a means of liberating modern political philosophy from the stranglehold of ideology. The essays are based on a long and intimate familiarity with the works, but the essay on Aristotle is especially important as one of Strauss's few writings on the philosopher who largely shaped Strauss's conception of antiquity. The essay on Plato is a full-scale discussion of Platonic political philosophy, wide in scope yet compact in execution. When discussing Thucydides, Strauss succeeds not only in presenting the historian as a moral thinker of high rank, but in drawing his thought into the orbit of philosophy, and thus indicating a relation of history and philosophy that does not presuppose the absorption of philosophy by history.},

How does this presence of others impact performances and behaviors in motor tasks and in the context of sports? This chapter gives a short overview about social facilitation research in motor tasks. In sports, social influence has already been investigated extensively. A particular interest within social influence research is the home advantage in team sports. Research in this field is concerned with understanding whether the performance of the home team is better due to more of their fans being in the stadium.},

This book explores the continuity of this tradition, suggesting that the sophists' intellectual balkanization in modern scholarship, particularly their low standing in comparison to the Presocratics, Platonists, and Aristotelians, is a direct result of Plato's condemnation of them and their practices. This book thus seeks to offer a revised history of the development of Greek philosophy, as well as of the potential--yet never realized--courses it might have followed.},

Meno will see the slave-boy learning, and this will show that he was recollecting. I wish to make the most of this opportunity to examine the presented data before considering the theory. To this I will devote the first and somewhat longer part of the paper, where I will seek by controversial argument to establish the right interpretation of the text. While doing this, it will be convenient to use “recollection” in quotes, suspending judgment upon its philosophical implications and even withholding attention from its dictionary meaning. Plato says the boy is “recollecting” and so shall I of this and all other situations which are equivalent to it in a sense which I shall make clear. When a decision has been reached on what exactly is taking place when people are “recollecting” in this purely nominative sense, it will be time to examine Plato's thesis that this “recollecting” is recollecting.},

  abstract = {The prion paradigm has emerged as a unifying molecular principle for the pathogenesis of many age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This paradigm holds that a fundamental cause of specific disorders is the misfolding and seeded aggregation of certain proteins. The concept arose from the discovery that devastating brain diseases called spongiform encephalopathies are transmissible to new hosts by agents consisting solely of a misfolded protein, now known as the prion protein. Accordingly, “prion” was defined as a “proteinaceous infectious particle.” As the concept has expanded to include other diseases, many of which are not infectious by any conventional definition, the designation of prions as infectious agents has become problematic. We propose to define prions as “proteinaceous nucleating particles” to highlight the molecular action of the agents, lessen unwarranted apprehension about the transmissibility of noninfectious proteopathies, and promote the wider acceptance of this revolutionary paradigm by the biomedical community.},

  abstract = {This essay gives an interpretation of the character of Thrasymachus in Plato’s               Republic               . Contrary to what recent commentators have claimed, Plato presents Thrasymachus as a horrifying figure, with a dark but coherent view of human life. According to this view, the principal good in life is domination over others: so in every significant interaction, one party is the winner, while the other is the loser. Justice is the vice of foolishly losing out to the more powerful, while injustice is the virtue of winning through one’s power and skill. Thrasymachus defends this account as revealing the deep phenomenon behind the law, and behind rulers’ declarations about justice and injustice. The               Republic               as a whole is a response to Thrasymachus’ view of the intrinsic benefits of injustice and intrinsic disadvantages of justice. But Thrasymachus represents this view in its most horrifying form—foreshadowing the discussion of the tyrant in book 9.},

  abstract = {Alcohol primarily interferes with the ability to form new long-term memories, leaving intact previously established long-term memories and the ability to keep new information active in memory for brief periods. As the amount of alcohol consumed increases, so does the magnitude of the memory impairments. Large amounts of alcohol, particularly if consumed rapidly, can produce partial (i.e., fragmentary) or complete (i.e., en bloc) blackouts, which are periods of memory loss for events that transpired while a person was drinking. Blackouts are much more common among social drinkers—including college drinkers—than was previously assumed, and have been found to encompass events ranging from conversations to intercourse. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of activity in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new auotbiographical memories.},

  abstract = {It is often said that to understand Plato we must understand his times. Many readers who might accept without question this saying of historical criticism may still wonder why we should think it necessary to begin our enquiry as far back as Homer and beyond. In the case of Plato there is an even greater need to pursue the argument back to the very beginnings of the historical period in which he lived and worked.It is quite impossible to understand the genesis of Plato's ideas without understanding the profound change that Greek society underwent in the post-Homeric period that preceded him. This change in social structure created a mercantile, progressive Greek society, one which laid the foundations for all the subsequent history of Europe and the West. The Genesis of Plato's Thought is particularly highly regarded because it departs vigorously from the traditional abstract, static view of Plato's thought.Winspear's volume on Plato's thought traces, in a realistic fashion, the deep-reaching social and economic roots of Plato's concept of the state and society. Winspear believes that nowhere can the social roots of philosophy be more sharply seen and more firmly apprehended than when one is dealing with the origins of Western philosophy among the Greeks. His book contains the body of information which any reader should have if they wish to approach Plato as a historical figure. To make the book useful to a wide circle of readers, brief biographical identifications for the various important figures of Greek life are introduced in the text.},

  abstract = {When individuals coordinate their behaviour, they need to both anticipate actions and respond to each other in meaningful ways. Jazz musicians often encounter situations in jam sessions in which they interact with previously unknown musicians, allowing insights into spontaneous collaboration. The current study investigated call and response patterns in free jazz improvisations by analysing movement and musical characteristics of duos. Twelve jazz musicians were paired into six duos of an e-guitar and a saxophone. Balanced across duos, one musician was asked to play a series of improvisations expressing the emotions happy, sad or neutral. The second musician responded to each improvisation without knowing the emotional intention of the first musician. Call and response roles were then exchanged. While musicians improvised or listened to their duo partner, they were both recorded with an optical motion capture system. Results indicate correspondences between call and response musicians in movement variability and cumulative distance of head motion. There were marked differences between happy and sad emotional expressions both in movement parameters and musical features including mean intensity, mode, and, albeit to a lesser extent, tempo. Retrospective verbal decoding of the call musicians’ emotional intentions was correct in 76.5\% of all cases. Independently of explicit decoding success and even for the first encounters, musicians spontaneously tuned into each other’s performances by means of their body movements and the musical characteristics of the improvisations.},

I take issue with Zimmerman's contention that the vagueness of 'garden variety' material objects such as brains or bodies makes them unsuitable candidates for the possession of phenomenal properties. I also argue that the 'speculative materialism' that is available to a substance materialist property dualist who abandons the identification of persons with such garden variety objects is significantly more attractive than Zimmerman allows. Although I do not attempt to refute its substance dualist rival, I conclude that the combination of property dualism with substance materialism can withstand Zimmerman's objections.},
