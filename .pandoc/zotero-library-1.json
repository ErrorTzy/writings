Thisconcerns especially his notorious critique of religion, and histeaching that the cosmos is produced through the interaction of five‚Äúeternal principles‚Äù, namely God, Soul, matter, time, andplace.

In each case the discussion unfolds not as advocacy of Platonic doctrines but as critical assessment of argument, and is meant as judicious explication of the logical form of significant theses often believed, during centuries of Platonic commentary, to be cornerstones of a monumental speculative system. It demonstrates a shared and strikingly high regard for Plato as a major thinker in the western philosophical tradition, a recognition that the dialogues he wrote continue to exert influence as well as attract theoretical attention.Taken together with the material on Plato in Volume II, Volume III displays a definite continuity in direction, scope, and quality, strengthening the conviction that Platonic scholarship has entered a new and different phase and has consolidated the approach that this new movement introduced.","author":[{"family":"Anton","given":"John P."},{"family":"Preus","given":"Anthony"}],"citation-key":"antonEssaysAncientGreek1989","ISBN":"978-0-7914-9504-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989",7,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"368","publisher":"State University of New York Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Essays in Ancient Greek Philosophy III: Plato","title-short":"Essays in Ancient Greek Philosophy III","type":"book"},

  {"id":"atkinsonHumanMemoryProposed1968","abstract":"This chapter presents a general theoretical framework of human memory and describes the results of a number of experiments designed to test specific models that can be derived from the overall theory. This general theoretical framework categorizes the memory system along two major dimensions. The first categorization distinguishes permanent, structural features of the system from control processes that can be readily modified or reprogrammed at the will of the subject. The second categorization divides memory into three structural components: the sensory register, the short-term store, and the long-term store. Incoming sensory information first enters the sensory register, where it resides for a very brief period of time, then decays and is lost. The short-term store is the subject's working memory; it receives selected inputs from the sensory register and also from long-term store. The chapter also discusses the control processes associated with the sensory register. The term control process refers to those processes that are not permanent features of memory, but are instead transient phenomena under the control of the subject; their appearance depends on several factors such as instructional set, the experimental task, and the past history of the subject.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Atkinson","given":"R.

  {"id":"backmanBrainActivationYoung1997","abstract":"Abstract\n            Positron emission tomography was used to study regional cerebral blood flow (H2 15O method) in groups of young and older adults during implicit and explicit retrieval, following a procedure devised by Squire et al. (1992). At study, subjects were exposed to four lists of words. Following list presentation, subjects were presented with three-letter word stems under four conditions: (1) silent viewing, (2) completion of word stems that could not form words from the study list, with the instruction to provide the first word that came to mind (baseline), (3) completion of word stems, half of which could form words from the study list, with the instruction to provide the first word that came to mind (priming), and (4) completion of word stems, half of which could form words from the study list, with the instruction to use the stems as cues for recall of list words (memory). The behavioral data indicated an agerelated deficit in cued recall that was reduced in priming. Both age groups showed a similar decrease of blood flow in right posterior cortex during priming relative to baseline. During cued recall, bilateral increases of blood flow were observed in prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus for both age groups. The young adults showed selective increases of activity in left cerebellum and Wernicke's area, whereas the older adults showed a selective bilateral activation in the perirhinal region of the medial-temporal cortex during cued recall. The results suggest a simiiar biological basis of priming in both age groups: a decrease in the neural activity required to process a particular stimulus during a subsequent encounter compared with a previous one. In addition, the importance of prefrontal regions for conscious retrieval was substantiated and extended to late adulthood. Finally, the agedifferential activations observed during cued recall were discussed relative to prominent concepts in the current literature on cognitive aging (e.g., speed of processing, self-initiated operations, cross-modal recoding).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"B√§ckman","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Almkvist","given":"Ove"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Jesper"},{"family":"Nordberg","given":"Agneta"},{"family":"Winblad","given":"Bengt"},{"family":"Reineck","given":"Robert"},{"family":"L√•ngstr√∂m","given":"Bengt"}],"citation-key":"backmanBrainActivationYoung1997","container-title":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1162/jocn.1997.9.3.378","ISSN":"0898-929X, 1530-8898","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",5,1]]},"language":"en","number":"3","page":"378-391","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Brain Activation in Young and Older Adults During Implicit and Explicit Retrieval","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/9/3/378/3254/Brain-Activation-in-Young-and-Older-Adults-During","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"barneyCalliclesThrasymachus2017","abstract":"Callicles and Thrasymachus are the two great exemplars in philosophyof contemptuous challenge to conventional morality. Both arecharacters in Platonic dialogues, in the Gorgias and Book Iof the Republic respectively; both denounce the virtue ofjustice, dikaiosun√™, as an artificial brake onself-interest, a fraud to be seen through by intelligent people.Together, Thrasymachus and Callicles have fallen into the folkmythology of moral philosophy as ‚Äòthe immoralist‚Äô (or‚Äòamoralist‚Äô). These are perhaps not quite the right words,but it is useful to have a label for their common challenge‚Äîmore generally, for the figure who demands a good reason to abide bymoral constraints, and denies, implicitly or explicitly, that thisdemand can be met.[1] Because of this shared agenda, and because Socrates‚Äô refutationof Callicles can be read as an unsatisfying rehearsal for theRepublic, it is tempting to assume that the two share asingle philosophical position. But in fact Callicles and Thrasymachusare by no means interchangeable; and the differences between them areimportant both for the interpretation of Plato and philosophically,for our understanding of the varieties of immoralism and themotivations behind it. This article discusses both the commonchallenge presented by these two figures and the features whichseparate them, treating them strictly as players in Plato‚Äôsphilosophical dramas. (Thrasymachus was a real person, a famousdiplomat and orator of whose real views we know only a little; ofCallicles we know nothing, and he may even be Plato‚Äôs invention.)[2] It will also compare them to a third Platonic version of theimmoralist challenge, the one presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus inRepublic Book II, and to the writings of sophist Antiphon‚Äîthe best-known real-life counterpart of all three Platonicviews, and perhaps their historical original. Certain aspects ofPlato‚Äôs own arguments against immoralism will also be discussed,insofar as they help to clarify what Callicles and Thrasymachusthemselves have to say.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Barney","given":"Rachel"}],"citation-key":"barneyCalliclesThrasymachus2017","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Fall 2017","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"license":"üìù‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê","publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Callicles and Thrasymachus","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/callicles-thrasymachus/"},

  {"id":"bedu-addoRecollectionArgumentHypothesis1984","abstract":"The dialogue begins with Meno's peremptory request: ‚ÄòCan you tell me, Socrates, whether virtue can be taught, or is it acquired by practice, not teaching ‚Ä¶?‚Äô (70a). Socrates protests that he does not know what virtue is, and hence cannot know whether it is teachable or not, explaining that in general if one does not know what a thing is,\n              œÑŒØ ·ºêœÉœÑŒπ\n              , one cannot know what it is like,\n              ·ΩÅœÄŒø·øñŒøŒΩ\n              (71b). He insists that the prior question of what virtue is must be settled before consideration of the subsequent question of whether it is teachable or not.\n            \n            \n              In accordance with this principle, Socrates gets Meno to make attempts to offer a general definition of virtue. As in earlier dialogues, Socrates quickly reduces his interlocutor to\n              aporia\n              , and Meno refuses to make further attempts at defining virtue on the ground that no criterion of truth exists. Socrates sums up his argument thus: ‚ÄòIt is impossible for a man to enquire into what he knows or into what he does not know. For he cannot enquire into what he knows, because he knows it, and there is no need for enquiry; nor again can he enquire into what he does not know, since he does not know about what he is to enquire into‚Äô (80e). Socrates describes this paradox as a piece of eristic, but he does not dismiss it. To resolve it, he introduces the theory of recollection,\n              ·ºÄŒΩŒ¨ŒºŒ∑œÉŒπœÅ\n              (81a‚Äìe).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bedu-Addo","given":"J.

  {"id":"bianPrevalenceImplicitConsumption2023","abstract":"In China, implicit consumption usually occurs in recent years. It has greatly troubled many consumers daily lives, but many people dont know how to change this problem. In this research, the author analyzed the causes, laws violated, and solutions of implicit consumption in the Chinese economic market. First of all, the author listed some examples of implicit consumption in the catering market and described the current situation, which is relatively common. Then, a study was designed through the difference-in-difference method to explore people's real attitudes and thoughts toward implicit consumption. By dividing random people and people with legal knowledge into two groups, three distinct points of view emerged, and the majority of them did not choose to defend their rights Through the results of this study, the author deeply analyzed the causes of implicit consumption, mainly from the perspective of customers' personal factors and legal policies. The lack of legal knowledge among people and the lack of strict restrictions in Chinese laws on implicit consumption have both influenced its prevalence. In addition, the author also indicated the laws violated by implicit consumption, including the right to know, the right to independent choice, and the law of clearly marking prices. Finally, the author put forward some solutions to solve implicit consumption. The problem of rampant implicit consumption in China can be solved by popularizing legal knowledge among consumers, strengthening market supervision by the regulatory department, and formulating clear legal provisions to limit implicit consumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bian","given":"Yueguo"}],"citation-key":"bianPrevalenceImplicitConsumption2023","container-title":"Lecture Notes in Education Psychology and Public Media","container-title-short":"LNEP","DOI":"10.54254/2753-7048/5/2022963","ISSN":"2753-7048, 2753-7056","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,17]]},"page":"818-823","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Prevalence of Implicit Consumption in China","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://lnep.ewapublishing.org/article.html?pk=e923d1eeecd548cc8e140925cfe67f97","volume":"5"},

Mice lacking C18ORF25 have reduced skeletal muscle Ô¨Åber size, exercise capacity, and muscle contractile function, and this was associated with reduced phosphorylation of contractile and Ca2+ handling proteins. Expression of C18ORF25 S66/67D phospho-mimetic reversed the decreased muscle force production.

  {"id":"blissLonglastingPotentiationSynaptic1973","abstract":"1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane.2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10-20/sec for 10-15 sec, or 100/sec for 3-4 sec.3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells.4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43%, and of the population spike in 40%, of all experiments.5. During conditioning at 10-20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (;frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation.6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.","author":[{"family":"Bliss","given":"T.

Political philosophers have takenthe organization of sex and reproduction to be essential to the healthof the state, and moral philosophers have debated whether marriage hasa special moral status and relation to the human good. Philosophershave also disputed the underlying moral and legal rationales for thestructure of marriage, with implications for questions such as thecontent of its moral obligations and the legal recognition of same-sexmarriage. Feminist philosophers have seen marriage as playing acrucial role in women‚Äôs oppression and thus a central topic ofjustice. In this area philosophy courts public debate: in 1940,Bertrand Russell‚Äôs appointment to an academic post was withdrawnon the grounds that the liberal views expressed in Marriage andMorals made him morally unfit for such a post. Likewise, debateover same-sex marriage has been highly charged. Unlike somecontemporary issues sparking such wide interest, there is a longtradition of philosophical thought on marriage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Brake","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"brakeMarriageDomesticPartnership2023","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Winter 2023","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."},{"family":"Nodelman","given":"Uri"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Marriage and Domestic Partnership","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2023/entries/marriage/"},
  {"id":"brakeMinimizingMarriageMarriage2012","abstract":"Even in secular and civil contexts, marriage retains sacramental connotations. Yet what moral significance does it have? This book examines its morally salient features -- promise, commitment, care, and contract -- with surprising results. In Part One, \"De-Moralizing Marriage,\" essays on promise and commitment argue that we cannot promise to love and so wedding vows are (mostly) failed promises, and that marriage may be a poor commitment strategy. The book contends with the most influential philosophical accounts of the moral value of marriage to argue that marriage has no inherent moral significance. Further, the special value accorded marriage sustains amatonormative discrimination - discrimination against non-amorous or non-exclusive caring relationships such as friendships, adult care networks, polyamorous groups, or urban tribes. The discussion raises issues of independent interest for the moral philosopher such as the possibilities and bounds of interpersonal moral obligations and the nature of commitment. The central argument of Part Two, \"Democratizing Marriage,\" is that liberal reasons for recognizing same-sex marriage also require recognition of groups, polyamorists, polygamists, friends, urban tribes, and adult care networks. Political liberalism requires the disestablishment of monogamous amatonormative marriage. Under the constraints of public reason, a liberal state must refrain from basing law solely on moral or religious doctrines; but only such doctrines could furnish reason for restricting marriage to male-female couples or romantic love dyads. Restrictions on marriage should thus be minimized. But public reason can provide a strong rationale for minimal marriage: care, and social supports for care, are a matter of fundamental justice. Part Two also responds to challenges posed by property division on divorce, polygyny, and supporting parenting, and builds on critiques of marriage drawn from feminism, queer theory, and race theory. It argues, using the example of minimal marriage, for the compatibility of liberalism and feminism.","author":[{"family":"Brake","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"brakeMinimizingMarriageMarriage2012","edition":"1st edition","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-977413-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,16]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"256","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"Amazon","title":"Minimizing Marriage: Marriage, Morality, and the Law","title-short":"Minimizing Marriage","type":"book"},

  {"id":"cabezaAgeRelatedDifferencesNeural1997","abstract":"Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to compare regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in young (mean 26 years) and old (mean 70 years) subjects while they were encoding, recognizing, and recalling word pairs. A multivariate partial-least-squares (PLS) analysis of the data was used to identify age-related neural changes associated with (1) encoding versus retrieval and (2) recognition versus recall. Young subjects showed higher activation than old subjects (1) in left prefrontal and occipito-temporal regions during encoding and (2) in right prefrontal and parietal regions during retrieval. Old subjects showed relatively higher activation than young subjects in several regions, including insular regions during encoding, cuneus/precuneus regions during recognition, and left prefrontal regions during recall. Frontal activity in young subjects was left-lateralized during encoding and right-lateralized during recall [hemispheric encoding/retrieval asymmetry (HERA)], whereas old adults showed little frontal activity during encoding and a more bilateral pattern of frontal activation during retrieval. In young subjects, activation in recall was higher than that in recognition in cerebellar and cingulate regions, whereas recognition showed higher activity in right temporal and parietal regions. In old subjects, the differences in blood flow between recall and recognition were smaller in these regions, yet more pronounced in other regions. Taken together, the results indicate that advanced age is associated with neural changes in the brain systems underlying encoding, recognition, and recall. These changes take two forms: (1) age-related decreases in local regional activity, which may signal less efficient processing by the old, and (2) age-related increases in activity, which may signal functional compensation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Cabeza","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Grady","given":"Cheryl L."},{"family":"Nyberg","given":"Lars"},{"family":"McIntosh","given":"Anthony R."},{"family":"Tulving","given":"Endel"},{"family":"Kapur","given":"Shitij"},{"family":"Jennings","given":"Janine M."},{"family":"Houle","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Craik","given":"Fergus I.

It has become more suitable to reach online social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn via the internet and web 3.0 technologies. Thus, people have shared their views on many different topics and their emotions with other users more widely on these platforms. This means that a huge amount of data is created on platforms where millions of people connect with each other through social networks. Nevertheless, the development of computational paradigms at high speed and complexity with technological possibilities allows analysis of valuable data by means of social network analysis methods. Our goal for this paper is to present a review of novel and popular online social network analysis problems with related applications and a reference work for researchers interested in analyzing online social network data and social network problems.

  {"id":"caroneMindBodyLate2005","abstract":"In this paper I re-examine the status of the mind-body relation in several of Plato‚Äôs late dialogues. A range of views has been attributed to Plato here. For example, it has been thought that Plato is a substance dualist, for whom the mind can exist independently of the body; or an attribute dualist, who has left behind the strong dualistic commitments of the Phaedo by allowing that the mind may be the subject of spatial movements. But even in cases where a classification of Plato as a holder of a particular ontology of the mind has been left undefined, it has been a shared assumption that in the late dialogues the mind itself must be immaterial. I take issue with these various views and show that none of them is necessitated by the text. In the first place, I argue there is strong evidence against the view that Plato should, in his late period, be committed not only to substance dualism, but also to attribute dualism. Furthermore, it is possible that Plato may have allowed that the mind itself be a three-dimensional corporeal entity (in a way that sets up a precedent for later Stoic developments). But even if this is not the only possible reading of the text, it is shown how at any rate the mind must be seen in late Plato as the principle of organization of a body and ontologically inseparable from it. Despite prima facie affinities with Aristotle here, we shall see a Plato emerge for whom the mind (without exception) and the body cannot exist without one another ‚Äì a thesis more radical than that of Aristotle‚Äôs. To bring out the provocative nature of this suggestion, I start, in section I, by laying out the state of the question and compare what I shall argue is the late Platonic view with standard interpretations of his previous work, stressing the historical force that I expect this thesis to have. Afterwards, in three respective sections, I proceed to pay heed to relevant passages in the Timaeus , Philebus and Laws in order to establish the main point of this paper. Finally, in section V, I consider the challenge apparently introduced against my thesis by Plato‚Äôs occasional talk of immortality and eschatology in those dialogues, and argue instead that many of those passages add further strength to the view defended in this essay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Carone","given":"Gabriela Roxana"}],"citation-key":"caroneMindBodyLate2005","DOI":"10.1515/agph.2005.87.3.227","ISSN":"1613-0650","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",10,18]]},"language":"en","license":"De Gruyter expressly reserves the right to use all content for commercial text and data mining within the meaning of Section 44b of the German Copyright Act.","number":"3","page":"227-269","publisher":"De Gruyter","section":"Archiv f√ºr Geschichte der Philosophie","source":"www.degruyter.com","title":"Mind and Body in Late Plato","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/agph.2005.87.3.227/html","volume":"87"},

  {"id":"choiVoicePhishingFraud2017","abstract":"Voice Phishing is an emergent crime in which victims are deceived during the course of a phone conversation. According to the crime statistics released by the Korean National Police Agency, over 4000 cases of voice phishing are committed per year and the cost per victim is over US$1000. However, because of its unique characteristics when compared with traditional fraud, few studies have been conducted on this subject. This is the first study assessing the modus operandi of voice phishing using crime script analysis. A total of 182 case files were analyzed, in addition to 229 posts in Internet portals. Moreover, 20 detectives in charge of voice phishing cases were consulted via in-depth interviews. The results showed that the preparation for phishing includes getting ready for the crime, recruiting telemarketers and creating the scripts. The next step involves randomly making international and Internet calls to a large number of people, which constitutes the major activity, while the post-activity involves the withdrawal and wiring of the money deposited by victims to the offenders. This research aimed to provide a foundation for future research on related crimes, including mutation phishing and pharming, and offer insights into effective policy implementation to control the crime by identifying its situational context and unique characteristics.","author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Kwan"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Ju-lak"},{"family":"Chun","given":"Yong-tae"}],"citation-key":"choiVoicePhishingFraud2017","container-title":"Security Journal","container-title-short":"Security Journal","DOI":"10.1057/sj.2014.49","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Voice phishing fraud and its modus operandi","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"craigWarLoverStudy1996","abstract":"This new examination of the Republic begins with questions ignored by most students of this famous and much-studied dialogue. Why is Plato's most extensive portrait of philosophy pervaded with the language and imagery of war? Why is a discussion supposedly about justice almost entirely about how to educate natural warriors? Why must the philosopher-kings of Kallipolis be first of all 'champions of war'? Why is the supposedly 'feminine drama' of Book Five preoccupied with war? The pursuit of questions such as these brings Craig to an understanding of Plato's teaching about justice, philosophy, and politics that differs radically from what is generally held today.The search for why the Republic's philosophers come from the ranks of 'war lovers' leads Craig to reassess the relation between the `city in logos' and timocracy (the regime openly dedicated to war), and this reassessment in turn brings a new perspective on Plato's political thought in general. Similarly, analysis of the timocratic man leads to a deeper understanding of the psychology on which the whole dialogue is based, especially its teaching about justice and its treatment of love. Following the dialogue's hint that language provides the `tracks' of ideas, Craig compares the four distinct kinds of love that figure in the dialogue, and thereby helps clarify several puzzling issues, not the least of which is the strange kinship between the philosopher and the tyrant. And through examining the peculiar problems posed by what he argues are two distinct kinds of timocrats - exemplified by Glaukon and Adeimantos - Craig illuminates the rationale underlying both educational schemes sketched in the dialogue: the political one of Books Two and Three and the pre-philosophical one of Book Seven. One chapter explores the analogical and allegorical dimensions of Book Five, as well as its actual political implications; there Craig offers clarification of the contemporary debate about sex roles. In bringing the Republic vividly to life, Craig shows that Plato's ideas on virtually all questions of permanent interest to human beings provide a corrective to views now in vogue. The War Lover is thus as much a commentary on contemporary intellectual and political life as it is a challenging new interpretation of an ancient text.","author":[{"family":"Craig","given":"Leon Harold"}],"citation-key":"craigWarLoverStudy1996","edition":"n edition","event-place":"Toronto ; Buffalo","ISBN":"978-0-8020-7942-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",6,30]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"440","publisher":"University of Toronto Press","publisher-place":"Toronto ; Buffalo","source":"Amazon","title":"The War Lover: A Study of Plato's Republic","title-short":"The War Lover","type":"book"},

  {"id":"davidsonInquiriesTruthInterpretation2001","abstract":"Abstract\n            This volume collects Davidson's seminal contributions to the philosophy of language. Its key insight is that the concept of truth can shed light on various issues connected to meaning: Davidson, who assumes a partial and primitive understanding of the truth predicate, reverses Tarski who had succeeded in elucidating the concept of truth by taking the notion of ‚Äòtranslation‚Äô (preservation of meaning) for granted. In the first of five subsections into which the papers are thematically organized, Davidson develops the systematic constraints a theory of meaning has to meet and shows how an approach to semantics based on the concept of truth meets these demands better than any rival approach. Sect. 2 explores whether one can give semantic analyses of quotation, intensional contexts, and force within the extensional limitations of the truth‚Äêtheoretic framework. Viewing the theories of meaning developed in the first section as empirical, Sect. 3 inquires into their testability: can we verify these theories without presupposing concepts too closely aligned to that of meaning, interpretation, and synonymy? Davidson develops constitutive constraints on applying truth theories to interpret the speech behaviour of others: we have to view utterances for the most part as assertions of the speaker's beliefs and those beliefs as largely true and consistent (he terms this the ‚ÄòPrinciple of Charity‚Äô). Sect. 4 combines these interpretative constraints with the semantic concept of truth developed in Sect. 1 to tackle metaphysical issues. Davidson claims that truth is not relative to conceptual schemes but only to languages that can be shown to be largely correct about the world; consequently, by studying those languages via the semantic concept of truth we can derive ontological conclusions. Sect. 5 explores aspects of linguistic usage that form a particular threat to theories of meaning (such as Davidson's) that focus on the literal meaning of sentences: for truth theory to be adequate as a general theory of language, it must give valid accounts of sentence mood, illocutionary force, and metaphorical meaning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Davidson","given":"Donald"}],"citation-key":"davidsonInquiriesTruthInterpretation2001","DOI":"10.1093/0199246297.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-924629-8 978-0-19-171518-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",9,27]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressOxford","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/10406"},

  {"id":"deansEvolutionSocialMedia2018","abstract":"This paper examines organizational impacts of social media on Fortune 100 companies over a 5-year period (2011‚Äì2016). Specifically, the study focuses on three broad areas of social media impact: (1) the adoption of social media platforms across industries and business models from 2011 to 2016, (2) the influence of social media adoption on the roles of the chief information officer (CIO) and chief marketing officer (CMO) and their changing relationships in companies over this time frame, and (3) the impact of social media on company strategy, governance, and the IT (information technology) and marketing functions. The results support the contention that the CMO role has evolved to meet the technology needs of the marketing function and that the relationship between the CMO and CIO has taken on greater importance. In most Fortune 100 companies in 2016, social media has transitioned to ownership by the marketing department and the CMO provides leadership for social media strategy while working closely with the CIO. This study contributes to a better understanding of the established role of social media in companies, governance structures, and the evolving roles of both the CIO and CMO in relation to social media trends. The study integrates the IT and marketing literature to provide an agenda for future work that builds on theory and establishes an ongoing cohesive research agenda.","author":[{"family":"Deans","given":"Penny"},{"family":"Tretola","given":"Betsy"}],"citation-key":"deansEvolutionSocialMedia2018","container-title":"Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce","container-title-short":"Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce","DOI":"10.1080/10919392.2018.1484597","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,3]]},"page":"173-192","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The evolution of social media and its impact on organizations and leaders","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

Accounting for how it is that we know that skeptical hypotheses are false and why it seems that we don‚Äôt know that they‚Äôre false tells us a lot, both about what knowledge is and how knowledge attributions work. Along the way, the following are all carefully explained and defended: Moorean methodological approaches to skepticism, on which one seeks to defeat, rather than refute, the skeptic; contextualist responses to skepticism; contextualist substantive Mooreanism; the basic safety approach to knowledge and the double-safety picture of what knowledge is; insensitivity accounts of various appearances of ignorance; the closure principle for knowledge; and the claim that our knowledge that we are not brains in vats is a priori, despite its being knowledge of a deeply contingent fact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"DeRose","given":"Keith"}],"citation-key":"deroseAppearanceIgnorance2018","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780199564477.001.0001","ISBN":"978-0-19-956447-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,15]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Appearance of Ignorance","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/32554","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"diekelmannMemoryFunctionSleep2010","abstract":"Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory, depending on the specific conditions of learning and the timing of sleep. Consolidation during sleep promotes both quantitative and qualitative changes of memory representations. Through specific patterns of neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep support system consolidation and synaptic consolidation, respectively. During SWS, slow oscillations, spindles and ripples - at minimum cholinergic activity - coordinate the re-activation and redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas during REM sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene activity - at high cholinergic and theta activity - might favour the subsequent synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex.","author":[{"family":"Diekelmann","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Born","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"diekelmannMemoryFunctionSleep2010","container-title":"Nature Reviews.

  {"id":"eptingCheersVsJeers2011","abstract":"Both athletes and fans believe that audience support (e.g., cheering) is one of the top influences on a team's success, particularly at home when the crowd is predominantly supportive, possibly contributing to reported home-field advantage (Courneya & Carron, 1992). Yet there are few experimental investigations of whether distinctive types of audience feedback have differential effects on athletes' performance of particular sports skills. In this study, college athletes performed a familiar task in their respective sport (pitching, free throw shooting, hitting a golf ball) in front of audiences who cheered, jeered, and remained silent, depending on the assigned condition. Basketball players' free throw performance was unaffected by audience condition, but jeers hurt performance for baseball pitchers, and jeers and cheers resulted in worse performance for golfers. Audiences or fans can impact performance, but impact may depend on sport, the specific sport skill, and specific audience behavior. Implications for understanding the role of audiences and home-field advantage are considered.","author":[{"family":"Epting","given":"L."},{"family":"Riggs","given":"K.N."},{"family":"Knowles","given":"J.D."},{"family":"Hanky","given":"J.J."}],"citation-key":"eptingCheersVsJeers2011","container-title":"North American Journal of Psychology","container-title-short":"North American Journal of Psychology","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6,1]]},"page":"299-312","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Cheers vs. Jeers: Effects of audience feedback on individual athletic performance","title-short":"Cheers vs. Jeers","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

I argue that although Thrasymachus does abandon a positivist conception of rulers and laws, this leaves his conventionalist understanding of justice in tact until his move to his more substantive statement of what justice is 343c.

  {"id":"foerdeRoleBasalGanglia2011","abstract":"It has long been known that memory is not a single process. Rather, there are different kinds of memory that are supported by distinct neural systems. This idea stemmed from early findings of dissociable patterns of memory impairments in patients with selective damage to different brain regions. These studies highlighted the role of the basal ganglia in non-declarative memory, such as procedural or habit learning, contrasting it with the known role of the medial temporal lobes in declarative memory. In recent years, major advances across multiple areas of neuroscience have revealed an important role for the basal ganglia in motivation and decision making. These findings have led to new discoveries about the role of the basal ganglia in learning and highlighted the essential role of dopamine in specific forms of learning. Here we review these recent advances with an emphasis on novel discoveries from studies of learning in patients with Parkinson's disease. We discuss how these findings promote the development of current theories away from accounts that emphasize the verbalizability of the contents of memory and towards a focus on the specific computations carried out by distinct brain regions. Finally, we discuss new challenges that arise in the face of accumulating evidence for dynamic and interconnected memory systems that jointly contribute to learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Foerde","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Shohamy","given":"Daphna"}],"citation-key":"foerdeRoleBasalGanglia2011","container-title":"Neurobiology of learning and memory","container-title-short":"Neurobiol Learn Mem","DOI":"10.1016/j.nlm.2011.08.006","ISSN":"1074-7427","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",11]]},"number":"4","page":"624-636","PMCID":"PMC3772079","PMID":"21945835","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The role of the basal ganglia in learning and memory: Insight from Parkinson's disease","title-short":"The role of the basal ganglia in learning and memory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772079/","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"frethamRoleIronLearning2011","abstract":"Iron deÔ¨Åciency (ID) is the most common nutrient deÔ¨Åciency, affecting 2 billion people and 30% of pregnant women and their offspring. Early life ID affects at least 3 major neurobehavioral domains, including speed of processing, affect, and learning and memory, the latter being particularly prominent. The learning and memory deÔ¨Åcits occur while the infants are iron deÔ¨Åcient and persist despite iron repletion. The neural mechanisms underlying the short- and long-term deÔ¨Åcits are being elucidated. Early ID alters the transcriptome, metabolome, structure, intracellular signaling pathways, and electrophysiology of the developing hippocampus, the brain region responsible for recognition learning and memory. Until recently, it was unclear whether these effects are directly due to a lack of iron interacting with important transcriptional, translational, or posttranslational processes or to indirect effects such as hypoxia due to anemia or stress. Nonanemic genetic mouse models generated by conditionally altering expression of iron transport proteins speciÔ¨Åcally in hippocampal neurons in late gestation have led to a greater understanding of iron‚Äôs role in learning and memory. The learning deficits in adulthood likely result from interactions between direct and indirect effects that contribute to abnormal hippocampal structure and plasticity. Adv.

  {"id":"fusterCrossmodalCrosstemporalAssociation2000","abstract":"The prefrontal cortex is essential for the temporal integration of sensory information in behavioural and linguistic sequences. Such information is commonly encoded in more than one sense modality, notably sight and sound. Connections from sensory cortices to the prefrontal cortex support its integrative function. Here we present the first evidence that prefrontal cortex cells associate visual and auditory stimuli across time. We gave monkeys the task of remembering a tone of a certain pitch for 10 s and then choosing the colour associated with it. In this task, prefrontal cortex cells responded selectively to tones, and most of them also responded to colours according to the task rule. Thus, their reaction to a tone was correlated with their subsequent reaction to the associated colour. This correlation faltered in trials ending in behavioural error. We conclude that prefrontal cortex neurons are part of integrative networks that represent behaviourally meaningful cross-modal associations. The orderly and timely activation of neurons in such networks is crucial for the temporal transfer of information in the structuring of behaviour, reasoning and language.","author":[{"family":"Fuster","given":"J.

  {"id":"georgeMeaningMarriageFamily2006","abstract":"The movement for same-sex marriage has triggered an unprecedented crisis in the social norms and laws governing marriage. All great civilizations have sought to unite, in the institution of marriage, the goods of sexual intimacy, childbearing and childrearing, and life-long love between adults. But the last five decades have witnessed the erosion of marriage as a public institution in the developed world. The separation of the goods previously united in marriage has led thoughtful people to question why marriage should be denied to homosexuals. This volume brings together the best of contemporary scholarship on marriage from a variety of disciplines¬óhistory, ethics, economics, law and public policy, philosophy, sociology, psychiatry, political science¬óto inform, and reform, public debate. Rigorous yet accessible, these studies aim to rethink and re-present the case for marriage as a positive institution and ideal that is in the public interest and serves the common good. The essays in this volume were presented to an audience of scholars, journalists, public policy experts, and other professionals, at a conference sponsored by the Witherspoon Institute. The authors are among the most eminent authorities on marriage and public policy in the English-speaking world.","citation-key":"georgeMeaningMarriageFamily2006","editor":[{"family":"George","given":"Robert P."},{"family":"Elshtain","given":"Jean Bethke"}],"event-place":"Dallas, Tex","ISBN":"978-1-890626-64-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1,1]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"316","publisher":"Spence Pub","publisher-place":"Dallas, Tex","source":"Amazon","title":"The Meaning of Marriage: Family, State, Market, And Morals","title-short":"The Meaning of Marriage","type":"book"},

Two structural isoforms of alpha-actinin (ACTN2 and ACTN3) are present in fast twitch (type 2) fibres of the skeletal muscle. ACTN3 gene has two alleles, R and X; the R allele is able to code for full length protein, while no functional protein results from the X allele due to a nonsense mutation (R577X) in exon 16 of ACTN3. The presence of X and R alleles of ACTN3 has been reported to affect the sprinting and endurance abilities of elite athletes. Therefore, ACTN3 is also known as the 'althlete gene'. The frequencies of the two alleles show considerable variation in different populations of the world. The aim of the present study was to determine the status of R and X alleles of ACTN3 in North Indian population. Using PCR-RFLP, we found homozygous R in 27 (22%), heterozygous RX in 76 (61%) and homozygous X in 22 (17%) out of 125 healthy voluntary blood donors. The study revealed that frequencies of both alleles and genotypes of ACTN3 in North Indians are similar to those of Caucasian populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Goel","given":"Himanshu"},{"family":"Mittal","given":"Balraj"}],"citation-key":"goelACTN3AthleteGene2007","container-title":"Current Science","ISSN":"0011-3891","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"number":"1","page":"84-86","publisher":"Temporary Publisher","source":"JSTOR","title":"ACTN3: Athlete gene prevalence in North India","title-short":"ACTN3","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24096827","volume":"92"},

  {"id":"gomez-torrenteRoadsReferenceEssay2019","abstract":"How is it that words (such as ‚ÄúAristotle‚Äù) come to stand for the things they stand for (such as Aristotle)? Is the thing that a word stands for, its reference, fully identified or described by conventions known to the users of the word? Or is there a more roundabout relation between the reference of a word and the conventions that determine or fix it? Do words like ‚Äúwater,‚Äù ‚Äúthree,‚Äù and ‚Äúred‚Äù refer to appropriate things, just as the word ‚ÄúAristotle‚Äù refers to Aristotle? If so, which things are these, and how do they come to be referred to by those words? In\n              Roads to Reference\n              , Mario G√≥mez-Torrente provides novel answers to these and other questions that have been of traditional interest in the theory of reference. The book introduces a number of cases of apparent indeterminacy of reference for proper names, demonstratives, and natural kind terms, which suggest that reference-fixing conventions for them adopt the form of lists of merely sufficient conditions for reference and reference failure. Arguments are then provided for a new anti-descriptivist picture of those kinds of words, according to which the reference-fixing conventions for them do not describe their reference. The book also defends realist and objectivist accounts of the reference of ordinary natural kind nouns, numerals, and adjectives for sensible qualities. According to these accounts, these words refer, respectively, to ‚Äúordinary kinds,‚Äù cardinality properties, and properties of membership in intervals of sensible dimensions, and these things are fixed in subtle ways by associated reference-fixing conventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"G√≥mez-Torrente","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"gomez-torrenteRoadsReferenceEssay2019","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780198846277.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-884627-7 978-0-19-188140-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,28]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Roads to Reference: An Essay on Reference Fixing in Natural Language","title-short":"Roads to Reference","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/35112"},

  {"id":"gouldProliferationGranuleCell1998","abstract":"Although granule cells continue to be added to the dentate gyrus of adult rats and tree shrews, this phenomenon has not been demonstrated in the dentate gyrus of adult primates. To determine whether neurons are produced in the dentate gyrus of adult primates, adult marmoset monkeys (\n              Callithrix jacchus\n              ) were injected with BrdU and perfused 2 hr or 3 weeks later. BrdU is a thymidine analog that is incorporated into proliferating cells during S phase. A substantial number of cells in the dentate gyrus of adult monkeys incorporated BrdU and ‚âà80% of these cells had morphological characteristics of granule neurons and expressed a neuronal marker by the 3-week time point. Previous studies suggest that the proliferation of granule cell precursors in the adult dentate gyrus can be inhibited by stress in rats and tree shrews. To test whether an aversive experience has a similar effect on cell proliferation in the primate brain, adult marmoset monkeys were exposed to a resident-intruder model of stress. After 1 hr in this condition, the intruder monkeys were injected with BrdU and perfused 2 hr later. The number of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus of the intruder monkeys was compared with that of unstressed control monkeys. We found that a single exposure to this stressful experience resulted in a significant reduction in the number of these proliferating cells. Our results suggest that neurons are produced in the dentate gyrus of adult monkeys and that the rate of precursor cell proliferation can be affected by a stressful experience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gould","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Tanapat","given":"Patima"},{"family":"McEwen","given":"Bruce S."},{"family":"Fl√ºgge","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Eberhard"}],"citation-key":"gouldProliferationGranuleCell1998","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

How NMN is taken up into cells has not been entirely clear. Here we show that the Slc12a8 gene encodes a specific NMN transporter. We find that Slc12a8 is highly expressed and regulated by NAD+ in the mouse small intestine. Slc12a8 knockdown abrogates the uptake of NMN in vitro and in vivo. We further show that Slc12a8 specifically transports NMN, but not nicotinamide riboside, and that NMN transport depends on the presence of sodium ion. Slc12a8 deficiency significantly decreases NAD+ levels in the jejunum and ileum, which is associated with reduced NMN uptake as traced by doubly labelled isotopic NMN. Finally, we observe that Slc12a8 expression is upregulated in the aged mouse ileum, which contributes to the maintenance of ileal NAD+ levels.

  {"id":"haythornthwaiteSocialNetworksInternet2005","abstract":"This paper explores the impact of communication media and the Internet on connectivity between people. Results from a series of social network studies of media use are used as background for exploration of these impacts. These studies explored the use of all available media among members of an academic research group and among distance learners. Asking about media use as well as about the strength of the tie between communicating pairs revealed that those more strongly tied used more media to communicate than weak ties, and that media use within groups conformed to a unidimensional scale, showing a configuration of different tiers of media use supporting social networks of different ties strengths. These results lead to a number of implications regarding media and Internet connectivity, including: how media use can be added to characteristics of social network ties; how introducing a medium can create latent tie connectivity among group members that provides the technical means for activating weak ties, and also how a change in a medium can disrupt existing weak tie networks; how the tiers of media use also suggest that certain media support different kinds of information flow; and the importance of organization-level decisions about what media to provide and promote. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for Internet effects.","author":[{"family":"Haythornthwaite","given":"Caroline"}],"citation-key":"haythornthwaiteSocialNetworksInternet2005","container-title":"Information, Communication and Society","container-title-short":"Information, Communication and Society","DOI":"10.1080/13691180500146185","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",6,1]]},"page":"125-147","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Social Networks and Internet Connectivity Effects","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

Using a repeated-measures design, each participant was seen on two occasions: once in music condition (Vivaldi's 'Spring' movement from 'The Four Seasons') and once in silence condition, with order counterbalanced. Considerable improvement was found for Alzheimer individuals' recall on the Autobiographical Memory Interview in the music condition, with an interaction for condition by group (p < 0.005). There were no differences in terms of overall arousal using galvanic skin response recordings or attentional errors during the Sustained Attention to Response Task. A significant reduction in state anxiety was found on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory in the music condition (p < 0.001), suggesting anxiety reduction as a potential mechanism underlying the enhancing effect of music on autobiographical memory recall.","author":[{"family":"Irish","given":"Muireann"},{"family":"Cunningham","given":"Conal J."},{"family":"Walsh","given":"J.

  {"id":"jensenSpeakingSystemSocial2017","abstract":"Social media have been associated with the coming of many-to-many forms of communication, but they also depend on many-to-one communication: bit trails or metadata that the users of digital media leave behind and which serve to structure future communications. Departing from a communicative rather than a technical understanding of metadata, this article discusses the place of many-to-one communication in the modus operandi of social media. Speaking into the system, users engage with media that are social in distinctive ways and, thus, participate in the structuration of particular forms of society, with or without their knowledge and consent. The rights and responsibilities of the users of social media can be addressed with reference to a principle of habeas data, which complements both habeas corpus and the classic freedoms of expression and access to information.","author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Helles","given":"Rasmus"}],"citation-key":"jensenSpeakingSystemSocial2017","container-title":"European Journal of Communication","container-title-short":"European Journal of Communication","DOI":"10.1177/0267323116682805","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,1]]},"page":"16-25","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Speaking into the system: Social media and many-to-one communication","title-short":"Speaking into the system","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"kaneEvolutionaryImplicationsSocial2017","abstract":"Social media has become a widely-adopted technology over the past decade, affecting organizations in myriad ways. One of the most important is the effect on organizational knowledge management, in which social media overcomes many of the limitations of previous generations of knowledge management technologies. In this paper, I explore the effects of social media on organizational knowledge management. In doing so, I argue that social media is not a monolithic class of technologies, but a diverse and evolving technological infrastructure that supports and changes the way people communicate and collaborate. Key aspects of social media have gone through a technological evolution over the past decade from cloud computing, to mobile technologies, and into analytics. Each of these shifts has distinct implications for organizational knowledge management, many of which have yet to be fully realized. Furthermore, trends suggest that social media will continue to evolve with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality, which will further influence how organizational knowledge management is practiced. This evolutionary perspective suggests we may be closer to the beginning than the end of how social media will affect organizations and their knowledge management practices. As such, a broad perspective on social media may provide many open areas for research in coming years.","author":[{"family":"Kane","given":"Gerald"}],"citation-key":"kaneEvolutionaryImplicationsSocial2017","container-title":"Information and Organization","container-title-short":"Information and Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.infoandorg.2017.01.001","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,26]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"The evolutionary implications of social media for organizational knowledge management","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"kapoorAdvancesSocialMedia2018","abstract":"Social media comprises communication websites that facilitate relationship forming between users from diverse backgrounds, resulting in a rich social structure. User generated content encourages inquiry and decision-making. Given the relevance of social media to various stakeholders, it has received significant attention from researchers of various fields, including information systems. There exists no comprehensive review that integrates and synthesises the findings of literature on social media. This study discusses the findings of 132 papers (in selected IS journals) on social media and social networking published between 1997 and 2017. Most papers reviewed here examine the behavioural side of social media, investigate the aspect of reviews and recommendations, and study its integration for organizational purposes. Furthermore, many studies have investigated the viability of online communities/social media as a marketing medium, while others have explored various aspects of social media, including the risks associated with its use, the value that it creates, and the negative stigma attached to it within workplaces. The use of social media for information sharing during critical events as well as for seeking and/or rendering help has also been investigated in prior research. Other contexts include political and public administration, and the comparison between traditional and social media. Overall, our study identifies multiple emergent themes in the existing corpus, thereby furthering our understanding of advances in social media research. The integrated view of the extant literature that our study presents can help avoid duplication by future researchers, whilst offering fruitful lines of enquiry to help shape research for this emerging field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kapoor","given":"Kawaljeet Kaur"},{"family":"Tamilmani","given":"Kuttimani"},{"family":"Rana","given":"Nripendra P."},{"family":"Patil","given":"Pushp"},{"family":"Dwivedi","given":"Yogesh K."},{"family":"Nerur","given":"Sridhar"}],"citation-key":"kapoorAdvancesSocialMedia2018","container-title":"Information Systems Frontiers","container-title-short":"Inf Syst Front","DOI":"10.1007/s10796-017-9810-y","ISSN":"1572-9419","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"531-558","source":"Springer Link","title":"Advances in Social Media Research: Past, Present and Future","title-short":"Advances in Social Media Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-017-9810-y","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"khallikanIbnKhallikanBiographical2010","abstract":"Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, or Deaths of Eminent Men and History of the Sons of the Epoch, was the noted Arabic scholar Ibn Khallikan's most well-known and respected work. The author worked on the tome from 1256 to 1274, compiling names, genealogies, and histories of prominent or conspicuous men in the Islamic world. The final work was translated into English by William MacGuckin de Slane and is longer than 2,700 pages. It has been quoted by many Arabic rhetoricians and grammarians in other works, as it is considered one of the most important records of Arabic history ever written. Here, separated into four volumes, the Biographical Dictionary is an essential work for any student of Muslim culture and literature. Volume III includes: A detailed index of all biographies; notes from the translator for each biography; and genealogies of hundreds of Muslim figures, including The Katib Imad Ad-Din Al-Ispahani, Abu Bakr Al-Khowarezmi, Mukhlis Ad-Dawla Mukallad, and Nasr Al-Khubzaruzzi. IBN KHALLIKAN (1211-1282) was a thirteenth century Arabic scholar who studied in Damascus, Mosul and Aleppo, specializing in the fields of language, theology, and law, including jurisprudence. He became a well-respected judge in Cairo, eventually becoming a chief judge in Damascus in 1261. Khallikan wrote several books, but his most well known was Deaths of Eminent Men and History of the Sons of the Epoch, often referred to as the \"Biographical Dictionary,\" which took him almost 20 years to complete. Khallikan retired from his position as judge just before his death in 1282.

Characterizing how false information proliferates on social platforms and why it succeeds in deceiving readers are critical to develop efficient detection algorithms and tools for early detection. A recent surge of research in this area has aimed to address the key issues using methods based on feature engineering, graph mining, and information modeling. Majority of the research has primarily focused on two broad categories of false information: opinion-based (e.g., fake reviews), and fact-based (e.g., false news and hoaxes). Therefore, in this work, we present a comprehensive survey spanning diverse aspects of false information, namely (i) the actors involved in spreading false information, (ii) rationale behind successfully deceiving readers, (iii) quantifying the impact of false information, (iv) measuring its characteristics across different dimensions, and finally, (iv) algorithms developed to detect false information.

  {"id":"ledouxEmotionalMemorySystems1993","abstract":"The neural mechanisms of emotion and memory have long been thought to reside side by side, if not in overlapping structures, of the limbic system. However, the limbic system concept is no longer acceptable as an account of the neural basis of memory or emotion and is being replaced with specific circuit accounts of specific emotional and memory processes. Emotional memory, a special category of memory involving the implicit (probably unconscious) learning and storage of information about the emotional significance of events, is modeled in rodent experiments using aversive classical conditioning techniques. The neural system underlying emotional memory critically involves the amygdala and structures with which it is connected. Afferent inputs from sensory processing areas of the thalamus and cortex mediate emotional learning in situations involving specific sensory cues, whereas learning about the emotional significance of more general, contextual cues involves projections to the amygdala from the hippocampal formation. Within the amygdala, the lateral nucleus (AL) is the sensory interface and the central nucleus the linkage with motor systems involved in the control of species-typical emotional behaviors and autonomic responses. Studies of cellular mechanisms in these pathways have focused on the direct relay to the lateral amygdala from the auditory thalamus. These studies show that single cells in AL respond to both conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus inputs, leading to the notion that AL might be a critical site of sensory-sensory integration in emotional learning. The thalamo-amygdala pathway also exhibits long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity that might underlie the emotional learning functions of the circuit. The thalamo-amygdala pathway contains and uses the amino acid glutamate in synaptic transmission, suggesting the possibility that an amino-acid mediated form of synaptic plasticity is involved in the emotional learning functions of the pathway. We are thus well on the way to a systems level and a cellular understanding of at least one form of emotional learning and memory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"LeDoux","given":"Joseph E."}],"citation-key":"ledouxEmotionalMemorySystems1993","container-title":"Behavioural Brain Research","container-title-short":"Behavioural Brain Research","DOI":"10.1016/0166-4328(93)90091-4","ISSN":"0166-4328","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",12,20]]},"number":"1","page":"69-79","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Emotional memory systems in the brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166432893900914","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"liuMoodStatusResponse2023","abstract":"Purpose: It is well known that there is an obvious 24 h diurnal variation in the individual‚Äôs mood state and physiological activity, and training at different times of the day may lead to different exercise performance and metabolic outcomes; however, the time-dependent effect of emotional state on physical activity and the inÔ¨Çuence of its circadian rhythm on exercise performance are still not comprehensively understood. Based on this, this study summarizes the rhythmic experimental research in the Ô¨Åeld of sport psychology, and it aims to provide the basis for coaches to optimize sports training scientiÔ¨Åcally and to improve the mental health of the related crowd to the greatest extent. Methods: The systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and CNKI databases for relevant literature; the search scope was research before September 2022. Results: 13 studies comprising 382 subjects examined the effects of exercise timing on mood responses to exercise or the effects of circadian rhythms of mood on exercise performance, which included 3 RCTs and 10 Non-RCTs. The subjects included athletes (both training or retired), college students, and healthy adults. Two studies were designed for long-term exercise intervention (aerobic training and RISE) and the rest for acute intervention (CrossFit training, HIIT, aerobic combined with muscle conditioning training, constant power exhaustion training, and cycling) or physical function tests (RSA + BTV tests, 30 s Wingate test, muscle strength + CMJ + swimming performance test, RSSJA, shooting accuracy tests + 10 √ó 20 m dribbling sprint, 200 m time trials). All trials reported speciÔ¨Åc exercise timing; of these, 10 studies reported subjects‚Äô chronotypes, most commonly using the MEQ scale, while 1 recorded with the CSM. Mood responses were assessed with the POMS scale in 10 studies, while 3 other studies used the UMACL, PANAS, and GAS scales, respectively. Conclusion: There was much inconsistency between the results, with subjects likely to be exposed to more sunlight (the main timing factor of the circadian rhythm) during early morning exercise, resulting in feeling more positive emotions; however, following a night‚Äôs rest, delayed responses and poor functioning of the various organ systems of the human body may also lead to higher feelings of fatigue and negative emotions indirectly. Conversely, for athletes, their physical function tests are also more susceptible to the circadian rhythm of emotions, suggesting the importance of synchronizing them. In addition, night owls‚Äô emotional state during physical activity seems to be more susceptible to exercise timing than that of early birds. In order to achieve the best emotional state, it is suggested that night owls arrange courses in the afternoon or evening in future training.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Hengxu"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jiaqi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tingran"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shiqi"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Jiong"}],"citation-key":"liuMoodStatusResponse2023","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"IJERPH","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph20042822","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,5]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","number":"4","page":"2822","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mood Status Response to Physical Activity and Its Influence on Performance: Are Chronotype and Exercise Timing Affect?","title-short":"Mood Status Response to Physical Activity and Its Influence on Performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/4/2822","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"lycosPlatoJusticePower1987","abstract":"Most commentaries on the Republic rush through Book I with embarrassment because the arguments of the participants, including Socrates, are specious. Beginning with Book II, the arguments are brilliant, so why did Plato write Book I? Lycos shows that the function of Book I is to attack the view that justice is external to the soul--external to the power humans have to render things good--and is merely instrumental to a good society. The dramatic situation in Book I presents justice as internal, requiring not laws, but discrimination and virtue.  After this introduction, the rest of the Republic serves to sketch out what virtue is and how to practice discrimination. Plato on Justice and Power ends with some illuminating contrasts between this sense of virtue and that characteristic of our modern liberal politics which takes an external view of justice similar to the Athenians view at the time of Plato.","author":[{"family":"Lycos","given":"Kimon"}],"citation-key":"lycosPlatoJusticePower1987","ISBN":"978-0-88706-415-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1987",1,1]]},"language":"en","license":"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê","number-of-pages":"220","publisher":"SUNY Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Plato on Justice and Power: Reading Book I of Plato's Republic","title-short":"Plato on Justice and Power","type":"book"},

Thiamine is a helper molecule (i.e., a cofactor) required by three enzymes involved in two pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. Because intermediate products of these pathways are needed for the generation of other essential molecules in the cells (e.g., building blocks of proteins and DNA as well as brain chemicals), a reduction in thiamine can interfere with numerous cellular functions, leading to serious brain disorders, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is found predominantly in alcoholics. Chronic alcohol consumption can result in thiamine deficiency by causing inadequate nutritional thiamine intake, decreased absorption of thiamine from the gastrointestinal tract, and impaired thiamine utilization in the cells. People differ in their susceptibility to thiamine deficiency, however, and different brain regions also may be more or less sensitive to this condition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Peter R."},{"family":"Singleton","given":"Charles K."},{"family":"Hiller-Sturmh√∂fel","given":"Susanne"}],"citation-key":"martinRoleThiamineDeficiency2003","container-title":"Alcohol Research & Health","container-title-short":"Alcohol Res Health","ISSN":"1535-7414","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"number":"2","page":"134-142","PMCID":"PMC6668887","PMID":"15303623","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The Role of Thiamine Deficiency in Alcoholic Brain Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6668887/","volume":"27"},

Through a textual analysis, the historical development and downfall of influential social media platforms is traced and a discussion of how media evolution theories applied along the way are provided. Results indicate early social media platforms competed with each other directly and marketed to the general population, largely supporting the functional equivalence theory of media evolution. Around the turn of the century, however, social networks experienced a theoretical shift. Sites competed less with each other and more for audience time and attention.

Evidence obtained in patients with late-onset amnesia resulting from medial temporal pathology has given rise to two opposing interpretations of the effects of such damage on long-term cognitive memory. One view is that cognitive memory, including memory for both facts and events, is served in a unitary manner by the hippocampus and its surrounding cortices; the other is that the basic function affected in amnesia is event memory, the memory for factual material often showing substantial preservation. Recent findings in patients with amnesia resulting from relatively selective hippocampal damage sustained early in life suggest a possible reconciliation of the two views. The new findings suggest that the hippocampus may be especially important for event as opposed to fact memory, with the surrounding cortical areas contributing to both. Evidence from neuroanatomical and neurobehavioural studies in monkeys is presented in support of this proposal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mishkin","given":"Mortimer"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Wendy A."},{"family":"Gadian","given":"David G."},{"family":"Vargha-Khadem","given":"Faraneh"}],"citation-key":"mishkinHierarchicalOrganizationCognitive1997","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.1997.0132","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1360","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"number":"1360","page":"1461-1467","publisher":"The Royal Society","source":"JSTOR","title":"Hierarchical Organization of Cognitive Memory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/56608","volume":"352"},

By drawing on cultural-, legal-, and ethical-based arguments, Mohr moves away from tired political rhetoric and reveals the important ways in which the struggle for gay rights and acceptance relates to mainstream American society, history, and political life.Mohr forcefully counters moralistic and religious arguments regularly invoked to keep gay men and women from achieving the same rights as heterosexuals. He examines the nature of prejudices and other cultural forces that work against lesbian and gay causes and considers the role that sexuality plays in the national rituals by which Americans define themselves. In his support of same-sex marriage, Mohr defines matrimony as the development and maintenance of intimacy through the means by which people meet their basic needs and carry out their everyday living. Mohr contends that this definition, in both its legal and moral sense, applies equally to homosexual and heterosexual couples. Mohr also considers gays and lesbians as community members as he explores the prospect for greater legal and social inclusion. He concludes by suggesting that recent progress in addressing civil rights for gays and lesbians and the nation's symbolic use of gay issues on both sides of the political spectrum calls for a culturally focused gay politics.","author":[{"family":"Mohr","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"mohrLongArcJustice2007","ISBN":"978-0-231-13521-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5,1]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"160","publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"Amazon","title":"The Long Arc of Justice: Lesbian and Gay Marriage, Equality, and Rights","title-short":"The Long Arc of Justice","type":"book"},

  {"id":"nussbaumSexSocialJustice2000","abstract":"What does it mean to respect the dignity of a human being? What sort of support do human capacities demand from the world, and how should we think about this support when we encounter differences of gender or sexuality? How should we think about each other across divisions that a legacy of injustice has created? In Sex and Social Justice, Martha Nussbaum delves into these questions and emerges with a distinctive conception of feminism that links feminist inquiry closely to the important progress that has been made during the past few decades in articulating theories of both national and global justice.Growing out of Nussbaum's years of work with an international development agency connected with the United Nations, this collection charts a feminism that is deeply concerned with the urgent needs of women who live in hunger and illiteracy, or under unequal legal systems. Offering an internationalism informed by development economics and empirical detail, many essays take their start from the experiences of women in developing countries. Nussbaum argues for a universal account of human capacity and need, while emphasizing the essential role of knowledge of local circumstance. Further chapters take on the pursuit of social justice in the sexual sphere, exploring the issue of equal rights for lesbians and gay men. Nussbaum's arguments are shaped by her work on Aristotle and the Stoics and by the modern liberal thinkers Kant and Mill. She contends that the liberal tradition of political thought holds rich resources for addressing violations of human dignity on the grounds of sex or sexuality, provided the tradition transforms itself by responsiveness to arguments concerning the social shaping of preferences and desires. She challenges liberalism to extend its tradition of equal concern to women, always keeping both agency and choice as goals. With great perception, she combines her radical feminist critique of sex relations with an interest in the possibilities of trust, sympathy, and understanding.Sex and Social Justice will interest a wide readership because of the public importance of the topics Nussbaum addresses and the generous insight she shows in dealing with these issues. Brought together for this timely collection, these essays, extensively revised where previously published, offer incisive political reflections by one of our most important living philosophers.","author":[{"family":"Nussbaum","given":"Martha C."}],"citation-key":"nussbaumSexSocialJustice2000","edition":"First Edition","event-place":"Oxford New York Athens","ISBN":"978-0-19-511210-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",8,24]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"488","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford New York Athens","source":"Amazon","title":"Sex and Social Justice","type":"book"},

This framework explains why the brain requires two differentially specialized learning and memory systems, and it nicely specifies their central properties (i.e., the hippocampus as a sparse, pattern-separated system for rapidly learning episodic memories, and the neocortex as a distributed, overlapping system for gradually integrating across episodes to extract latent semantic structure). We review the application of the CLS framework to a range of important topics, including the following: the basic neural processes of hippocampal memory encoding and recall, conjunctive encoding, human recognition memory, consolidation of initial hippocampal learning in cortex, dynamic modulation of encoding versus recall, and the synergistic interactions between hippocampus and neocortex. Overall, the CLS framework remains a vital theoretical force in the field, with the empirical data over the past 15 years generally confirming its key principles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"O‚ÄôReilly","given":"Randall C."},{"family":"Bhattacharyya","given":"Rajan"},{"family":"Howard","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Ketz","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"oreillyComplementaryLearningSystems2014","container-title":"Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1551-6709.2011.01214.x","ISSN":"1551-6709","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright ¬© 2011 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.","number":"6","page":"1229-1248","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Complementary Learning Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2011.01214.x","volume":"38"},

Using dynamic game method, the interaction between local government and pollution discharging enterprises is studied in the process of environmental regulation implementation, implementation behaviors and their influencing factors are analyzed, and empirically tested by Structural Equation Model. The results show that increasing marginal inspection budget and reducing marginal inspection cost can improve the inspection probability of local government; reducing the influence coefficient of enterprise profit on local government utility, increasing the weight coefficient of environmental indicators in the performance appraisal system, and increasing the administrative penalty rate, can improve the probability of levy and penalty on pollution discharging enterprises. Reducing the emission standard of pollution can increase the penalty probability; increasing pollution discharge fee rate will reduce the penalty probability on pollution discharging enterprises, while increasing the fine rate for excessive pollution will reduce the levy probability imposed on enterprises by local governments. Empirical test verifies the above theoretical analysis results. Based on the above research conclusions, it is necessary to revise incentive mechanism and restrain behavior orientation of local governments, gradually increase the environmental inspection budget, reduce the environmental inspection cost, increase rewards and punishments of environmental protection activities, reduce the influence of enterprise profit on local government utility, and scientifically formulate environmental protection standards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pan","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lin"}],"citation-key":"panInfluencingFactorsAnalysis2022","container-title":"Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society","container-title-short":"Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society","DOI":"10.1155/2022/9493877","editor":[{"family":"Coronel","given":"Anibal"}],"ISSN":"1607-887X, 1026-0226","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,16]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1-14","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Influencing Factors Analysis of Local Environmental Regulation Implementation Behaviors in China: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Test","title-short":"Influencing Factors Analysis of Local Environmental Regulation Implementation Behaviors in China","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2022/9493877/","volume":"2022"},

  {"id":"prietocurielCrimeItsFear2020","abstract":"Social media posts incorporate real-time information that has, elsewhere, been exploited to predict social trends. This paper considers whether such information can be useful in relation to crime and fear of crime. A large number of tweets were collected from the 18 largest Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, over a period of 70 days. These tweets are then classiÔ¨Åed as being crime-related or not and additional information is extracted, including the type of crime and where possible, any geo-location at a city level. From the analysis of collected data, it is established that around 15 out of every 1000 tweets have text related to a crime, or fear of crime. The frequency of tweets related to crime is then compared against the number of murders, the murder rate, or the level of fear of crime as recorded in surveys. Results show that, like mass media, such as newspapers, social media suffer from a strong bias towards violent or sexual crimes. Furthermore, social media messages are not highly correlated with crime. Thus, social media is shown not to be highly useful for detecting trends in crime itself, but what they do demonstrate is rather a reÔ¨Çection of the level of the fear of crime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Prieto Curiel","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Cresci","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Muntean","given":"Cristina Ioana"},{"family":"Bishop","given":"Steven Richard"}],"citation-key":"prietocurielCrimeItsFear2020","container-title":"Palgrave Communications","container-title-short":"Palgrave Commun","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-020-0430-7","ISSN":"2055-1045","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,2]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"57","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Crime and its fear in social media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0430-7","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"racetteLearningLyricsSing2007","abstract":"According to common practice and oral tradition, learning verbal materials through song should facilitate word recall. In the present study, we provide evidence against this belief. In Experiment 1, 36 university students, half of them musicians, learned an unfamiliar song in three conditions. In the sung-sung condition, the song to be learned was sung, and the response was sung too. In the sung-spoken condition, the response was spoken. In the divided-spoken condition, the presented lyrics (accompanied by music) and the response were both spoken. Superior word recall in the sung-sung condition was predicted. However, fewer words were recalled when singing than when speaking. Furthermore, the mode of presentation, whether sung or spoken, had no influence on lyric recall, in either short- or long-term recall. In Experiment 2, singing was assessed with and without words. Altogether, the results indicate that the text and the melody of a song have separate representations in memory, making singing a dual task to perform, at least in the first steps of learning. Interestingly, musical training had little impact on performance, suggesting that vocal learning is a basic and widespread skill.","author":[{"family":"Racette","given":"Am√©lie"},{"family":"Peretz","given":"Isabelle"}],"citation-key":"racetteLearningLyricsSing2007","container-title":"Memory & cognition","container-title-short":"Memory & cognition","DOI":"10.3758/BF03193445","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",4,1]]},"page":"242-53","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Learning lyrics: To sing or not to sing?","title-short":"Learning lyrics","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"reberNeuralBasisImplicit2013","abstract":"Memory systems research has typically described the different types of long-term memory in the brain as either declarative versus non-declarative or implicit versus explicit. These descriptions reÔ¨Çect the difference between declarative, conscious, and explicit memory that is dependent on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system, and all other expressions of learning and memory. The other type of memory is generally deÔ¨Åned by an absence: either the lack of dependence on the MTL memory system (nondeclarative) or the lack of conscious awareness of the information acquired (implicit). However, deÔ¨Ånition by absence is inherently underspeciÔ¨Åed and leaves open questions of how this type of memory operates, its neural basis, and how it differs from explicit, declarative memory. Drawing on a variety of studies of implicit learning that have attempted to identify the neural correlates of implicit learning using functional neuroimaging and neuropsychology, a theory of implicit memory is presented that describes it as a form of general plasticity within processing networks that adaptively improve function via experience. Under this model, implicit memory will not appear as a single, coherent, alternative memory system but will instead be manifested as a principle of improvement from experience based on widespread mechanisms of cortical plasticity. The implications of this characterization for understanding the role of implicit learning in complex cognitive processes and the effects of interactions between types of memory will be discussed for examples within and outside the psychology laboratory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Reber","given":"Paul J."}],"citation-key":"reberNeuralBasisImplicit2013","container-title":"Neuropsychologia","container-title-short":"Neuropsychologia","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.06.019","ISSN":"00283932","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8]]},"language":"en","number":"10","page":"2026-2042","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The neural basis of implicit learning and memory: A review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging research","title-short":"The neural basis of implicit learning and memory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002839321300208X","volume":"51"},

The impact of school-based music programs on memory processes is however relatively unknown. The current study explored the effect of increasing frequency and intensity of classroom-based instrumental training program on verbal and visual memory across a two year period. Data from 142 participants were analysed: 82 (41 female (F), 41 male (M); mean age 8.62 years) allocated to the intensive strings music training program and 68 (37F, 31M; mean age 8.79 years) allocated to the control group (usual music classes). The Children‚Äôs Memory Scale was used to test digit span, verbal learning and immediate and delayed verbal memory. Immediate visual recall was tested using the Benton Visual Designs test. Mixed model ANOVAs revealed that students receiving the intensive music training program exhibited significantly better learning and immediate recall for verbal information, after approximately one year, but not two years, after implementation of the program than did controls. No such benefit was observed following one year of a similarly novel juggling program in a sub-set of the sample. As anticipated, the intensive music training had no effect on visual memory, although an improvement in visual perceptual ability and digit span recall was observed in the first year also. The current findings have implications for educational programs (such as literacy training) which may benefit from transient improvements in verbal memory.","author":[{"family":"Rickard","given":"Nikki S"},{"family":"Vasquez","given":"Jorge T"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Fintan"},{"family":"Gill","given":"Anneliese"},{"family":"Toukhsati","given":"Samia R"}],"citation-key":"rickardInstrumentalMusicProgram2010","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","number":"1","source":"Zotero","title":"instrumental music program on verbal memory of primary school children: a longitudinal study","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"robinsonDualism2023","abstract":"This entry concerns dualism in the philosophy of mind. The term‚Äòdualism‚Äô has a variety of uses in the history ofthought.

In theology, for example a ‚Äòdualist‚Äô issomeone who believes that Good and Evil ‚Äì or God and the Devil ‚Äì are independent and more or less equal forces in theworld. Dualism contrasts with monism, which is the theory that thereis only one fundamental kind, category of thing or principle; and,rather less commonly, with pluralism, which is the view that there aremany kinds or categories.  In the philosophy of mind, dualism is thetheory that the mental and the physical ‚Äì or mind and body ormind and brain ‚Äì are, in some sense, radically different kindsof things. Because common sense tells us that there are physicalbodies, and because there is intellectual pressure towards producing aunified view of the world, one could say that materialist monism isthe ‚Äòdefault option‚Äô. Discussion about dualism, therefore,tends to start from the assumption of the reality of the physicalworld, and then to consider arguments for why the mind cannot betreated as simply part of that world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"Howard"}],"citation-key":"robinsonDualism2023","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Spring 2023","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."},{"family":"Nodelman","given":"Uri"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Dualism","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2023/entries/dualism/"},

Results confirmed the hypothesis showing a strong learning facilitation of song compared to speech. Most importantly, the present results show that learning a new language, especially in the first learning phase wherein one needs to segment new words, may largely benefit of the motivational and structuring properties of music in song.","author":[{"family":"Sch√∂n","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Boyer","given":"Maud"},{"family":"Moreno","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Besson","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Peretz","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Kolinsky","given":"Regine"}],"citation-key":"schonSongAidLanguage2008","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2007.03.005","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,1]]},"page":"975-83","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Song as an aid for language acquisition","type":"article-journal","volume":"106"},

  {"id":"sedleyPlatonicCauses1998","abstract":"This paper examines Plato's ideas on cause-effect relations in the \"Phaedo.\" It maintains that he sees causes as things (not events, states of affairs or the like), with any information as to how that thing brings about the effect relegated to a strictly secondary status. This is argued to make good sense, so long as we recognise that aition means the \"thing responsible\" and exploit legal analogies in order to understand what this amounts to. Furthermore, provided that we do not pre-suppose that we already know what can and what cannot count as a cause, Plato proves to have an attractive case for his principle that all causation is a matter of like causing like. Once we appreciate this, we are a little closer to understanding his more idiosyncratic principle, which although puzzling is ubiquitous in his writings and often invoked as a premise in key arguments, that opposites cannot cause opposites. The last part of the paper turns to formal causes, defending Plato's advocacy of them, and examining their role in the \"Parmenides'\" Third Man Argument. The main proposal is that Plato's conception of Forms as causes opens the door to a better version of that argument's \"Non-identity\" premise than those currently available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Sedley","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"sedleyPlatonicCauses1998","container-title":"Phronesis","DOI":"10.2307/4182582","ISSN":"0031-8868","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"number":"2","page":"114-132","publisher":"Brill","source":"JSTOR","title":"Platonic Causes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4182582","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"shapiroVaguenessContext2006","abstract":"Abstract\n            This book develops both a philosophical and a formal, model-theoretic account of the meaning, function, and logic of vague terms in an idealized version of a natural language like English. Extensions of vague terms vary with such contextual factors as the comparison class and paradigm cases: a person can be tall with respect to male accountants and not tall (even short) with respect to professional basketball players. The main feature of the author's account is that the extensions (and anti-extensions) of vague terms also vary in the course of a conversation, even after the external contextual features, such as the comparison class, are fixed. A central thesis is that in some cases, a competent speaker of the language can go either way in the borderline area of a vague predicate without sinning against the meaning of the words and the non-linguistic facts. Shapiro calls thisopen texture, borrowing the term from Friedrich Waismann. The formal model theory has a similar structure to the supervaluationist approach, employing the notion of a sharpening of a base interpretation. In line with the philosophical account, however, the notion of super-truth does not play a central role in the development of validity. The ultimate goal of the technical aspects of the work is to delimit a plausible notion of logical consequence, and to explore what happens with the sorites paradox. Later chapters deal with what passes for higher-order vagueness ‚Äî vagueness in the notions of ‚Äòdeterminacy‚Äô and ‚Äòborderline‚Äô ‚Äî and with vague singular terms, or objects. In each case, the philosophical picture is developed by extending and modifying the original account. This is followed with modifications to the model theory and the central meta-theorems. In this book, vagueness is seen as a linguistic phenomenon, due to the kinds of languages that humans speak. But vagueness is also due to the world we find ourselves in, as we try to communicate features of it to each other. Vagueness is also due to the kinds of beings we are.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Stewart"}],"citation-key":"shapiroVaguenessContext2006","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199280391.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-928039-1 978-0-19-170716-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1,5]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressOxford","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Vagueness in Context","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/3722"},

  {"id":"singhElectricalEnergyGeneration2023","abstract":"A green electrical energy source is suggested in this study to reduce carbon emissions for application in wearable flexible smart sensors/electronics/medical devices. Fish scales of Rohu fish are used to produce electricity by designing and fabricating triboelectric nanogenerators which need only human motion instead of a battery to produce electricity for self powered sensors and IoT devices. These fish scales are available in abundance in a fish market as a waste material globally. These scales are transparent, flexible, non-toxic, biodegradable, biocompatible, and cheaper (free of cost) material. A very simple design, fabrication, and operation technique is proposed in this study. The various characterization techniques SEM, EDX, FTIR, and XRD are performed on the fish scale because triboelectricity generation depends upon the material composition and surface morphology. The SEM results show a distinct surface pattern of the scale which is helpful for triboelectric charge generation. The EDX shows the basic elemental composition in which Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen are dominant. Further, the FTIR spectrum shows the presence of different bio proteins including keratin, collagens, chitin, etc. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that a fish scale-based fabricated device is capable of working under 2000 C. A comparative analysis of the triboelectric performance of fish scale with other already reported biomaterials eggshell membrane, dog hair, and Bombax ceiba tree cotton is also presented in this study along with highly tribonegative material PTFE. The results of this study help to estimate the position of the novel fish scale material in the triboelectric series. The electrical output of this fish scale-based device is used to light up 90 commercial green LEDs which is equivalent to 180¬†V. The current of value 1.7¬†¬µA has been measured across the 1¬†MŒ© resistor. To present the potential application of the fabricated device, a digital calculator is Switch ON using electricity produced from the fish scale based device.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Singh","given":"Harminder"},{"family":"Sheetal","given":"Anu"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Maninder"},{"family":"Kaur","given":"Jaspreet"},{"family":"Sui","given":"Tan"},{"family":"Loja","given":"M.

The country has essentially been in a state of various civil wars since its independence in 1948. The period from 2010 saw the opening up of the telecommunications sector and a rapid uptake in social media. The spread of smartphones has opened up communication to the masses and provided them with access to information; the Myanmar Military has also used it to spread disinformation. These campaigns are used to uphold the state, people and religion. To the military, this essentially means the Burman (Bamar) majority, the Buddhist religion and the unitary state (with the military as its guardian). In many of these endeavours, they have been supported by non-state actors such as militant Buddhist monks.

The basic idea of degrees of truth is that while some sentences are true and some are false, others possess intermediate truth values: they are truer than the false sentences, but not as true as the true ones.

The book seeks to turn the tide in favour of a degree-theoretic treatment of vagueness, by motivating and defending the basic idea that truth can come in degrees, by arguing that no theory of vagueness that does not countenance degrees of truth can be correct, and by developing a new degree-theoretic treatment of vagueness ‚Äî fuzzy plurivaluationism ‚Äî that solves the problems plaguing earlier degree theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Nicholas J.

  {"id":"soamesUnderstandingTruth1999","abstract":"Abstract\n            Understanding Truth aims to illuminate the notion of truth, and the role it plays in our ordinary thought, as well as in our logical, philosophical, and scientific theories. Part 1 is concerned with substantive background issues: the identification of the bearers of truth, the basis for distinguishing truth from other notions, like certainty, with which it is often confused, and the formulation of positive responses to well‚Äêknown forms of philosophical skepticism about truth. Having cleared away the grounds for truth skepticism, the discussion turns in Part 2 to an explication of the formal theories of Alfred Tarski and Saul Kripke, including their treatments of the Liar paradox (illustrated by sentences like This sentence is not true). The success of Tarski's definition of truth in avoiding the Liar, and his ingenious use of the paradox in proving the arithmetical indefinability of arithmetical truth, are explained, and the fruitfulness of his definition in laying the foundations for the characterization of logical consequence in terms of truth in a model is defended against objections. Nevertheless, it is argued that the notion of truth defined by Tarski does not provide an adequate analysis of our ordinary notion because there are intellectual tasks for which we need a notion of truth other than Tarski's. There are also problems with applying his hierarchical approach to the Liar as it arises in natural language ‚Äì problems that are avoided by Kripke's more sophisticated model. Part 2 concludes with an explanation of Kripke's theory of truth, which is used to motivate a philosophical conception of partially defined predicates ‚Äì i.e., predicates that are governed by sufficient conditions for them to apply to an object, and sufficient conditions for them to fail to apply, but no conditions that are both individually sufficient and jointly necessary for the predicates to apply, or for them to fail to apply. While the advantages of understanding are true, to be a predicate of this sort are stressed at the end of Part 2, a theory of vague predicates according to which they are both partially defined and context sensitive is presented in Part 3. This theory is used to illuminate and resolve certain important puzzles posed by the Sorites paradox: a newborn baby is young, if someone is young at a certain moment, then that person is still young one second later, so everyone is young. The book closes with an attempt to incorporate important insights of Tarski and Kripke into a broadly deflationary conception of truth, as we ordinarily understand it in natural language and use it in philosophy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Soames","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"soamesUnderstandingTruth1999","DOI":"10.1093/0195123352.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-512335-7 978-0-19-987211-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",1,28]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressNew York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Understanding Truth","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/12444"},

  {"id":"straussCityMan1978","abstract":"The City and Man consists of provocative essays by the late Leo Strauss on Aristotle's Politics, Plato's Republic, and Thucydides' Peloponnesian Wars. Together, the essays constitute a brilliant attempt to use classical political philosophy as a means of liberating modern political philosophy from the stranglehold of ideology. The essays are based on a long and intimate familiarity with the works, but the essay on Aristotle is especially important as one of Strauss's few writings on the philosopher who largely shaped Strauss's conception of antiquity. The essay on Plato is a full-scale discussion of Platonic political philosophy, wide in scope yet compact in execution. When discussing Thucydides, Strauss succeeds not only in presenting the historian as a moral thinker of high rank, but in drawing his thought into the orbit of philosophy, and thus indicating a relation of history and philosophy that does not presuppose the absorption of philosophy by history.","author":[{"family":"Strauss","given":"Leo"}],"citation-key":"straussCityMan1978","edition":"Later Reprint edition","event-place":"Chicago","ISBN":"978-0-226-77701-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1978",11,15]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"254","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago","source":"Amazon","title":"The City and Man","type":"book"},
  {"id":"straussSocialInfluenceSport2021","abstract":"Social influence has been summarised as the change in one‚Äôs beliefs, behaviour, or attitudes due to external pressure that may be real or imagined (Cialdini, 2001). In this chapter, we focus on the question of how (sports-relevant) behaviour and athletic performances are influenced by others, especially active and passive (sports) spectators. You have probably already experienced giving a presentation in front of a group of people. Were you influenced by the presence of your audience? Was your performance better, worse, or unaffected compared to the rehearsal session, when you practised alone? Is your performance influenced differently when the audience listens attentively as opposed to when they are noisily not paying attention? How does this presence of others impact performances and behaviours in the context of sports? In sports, social influence has already been investigated extensively (cf. Epting, Riggs, Knowles, &amp; Hanky, 2011; cf. Strauss, 2002b). A particular interest within social influence research is the home advantage in team sports (Allen &amp; Jones, 2014; Carron, Loughhead, &amp; Bray, 2005).

By studying the sophists against the backdrop of the archaic Greek institutions of wisdom, it is possible to detect considerable intellectual overlap between them and their predecessors. This book explores the continuity of this tradition, suggesting that the sophists' intellectual balkanization in modern scholarship, particularly their low standing in comparison to the Presocratics, Platonists, and Aristotelians, is a direct result of Plato's condemnation of them and their practices. This book thus seeks to offer a revised history of the development of Greek philosophy, as well as of the potential--yet never realized--courses it might have followed.","author":[{"family":"Tell","given":"H√•kan"}],"citation-key":"tellPlatoCounterfeitSophists2011","ISBN":"978-0-674-05591-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"190","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Plato's Counterfeit Sophists","type":"book"},

It begins by motivating and explaining the idea of a degree of belief (also known as a \"credence\"). It then presents Bayesians' five core normative rules governing degrees of belief: Kolmogorov's three probability axioms, the Ratio Formula for conditional credences, and Conditionalization for updating credences over time. After considering a few proposed additions to these norms, it applies the core rules to confirmation and decision theory. The book then details arguments for the Bayesian rules based on representation theorems, Dutch Books, and accuracy measures. Finally, it looks at objections and challenges to Bayesian epistemology. It presents problems concerning memory loss, self-location, old evidence, logical omniscience, and the subjectivity of priors. It considers the rival statistical paradigms of frequentism and likelihoodism. Then it explores alternative Bayesian-style formalisms involving comparative confidence rankings, credences ranges, and Dempster-Shafer functions\"--","author":[{"family":"Titelbaum","given":"Michael G."}],"call-number":"QA279.5 .T58 2022","citation-key":"titelbaumFundamentalsBayesianEpistemology2022","edition":"First edition","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-19-870760-8 978-0-19-870761-5 978-0-19-286314-0 978-0-19-286315-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Fundamentals of Bayesian epistemology","type":"book"},

Accordingly, ‚Äúprion‚Äù was defined as a ‚Äúproteinaceous infectious particle.‚Äù As the concept has expanded to include other diseases, many of which are not infectious by any conventional definition, the designation of prions as infectious agents has become problematic.

  {"id":"weberEmergenceEvolutionSocial2016","abstract":"A number of new organizational structures have emerged in recent years, including peer production networks, digitally organized social movements, and social networking sites (SNSs). Researchers have devoted considerable attention to these phenomena as groups and communities. This article takes a complementary approach by conceptualizing them as organizational forms, with focus on the emergence of SNSs as a distinct organizational form. Community ecology theory is implemented to explicate the emergence and subsequent legitimation of organizational forms, providing a foundation for understanding how new forms emerge through interaction with the surrounding environment. Industry data and historical records are utilized to illustrate the development of one specific form: online SNSs. This analysis demonstrates that legitimation is an ongoing process of replication of features, but legitimacy also occurs through recognition from adjacent populations. Findings illustrate the validity of alternative processes of form legitimacy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Matthew S."},{"family":"Fulk","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Monge","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"weberEmergenceEvolutionSocial2016","container-title":"Management Communication Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0893318916629547","ISSN":"0893-3189","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,1]]},"page":"305-332","source":"Experts@Minnesota","title":"The Emergence and Evolution of Social Networking Sites as an Organizational Form","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?scp=84977472669&partnerID=8YFLogxK","volume":"30"},

Contrary to what recent commentators have claimed, Plato presents Thrasymachus as a horrifying figure, with a dark but coherent view of human life. According to this view, the principal good in life is domination over others: so in every significant interaction, one party is the winner, while the other is the loser. Justice is the vice of foolishly losing out to the more powerful, while injustice is the virtue of winning through one‚Äôs power and skill. Thrasymachus defends this account as revealing the deep phenomenon behind the law, and behind rulers‚Äô declarations about justice and injustice. The\n              Republic\n              as a whole is a response to Thrasymachus‚Äô view of the intrinsic benefits of injustice and intrinsic disadvantages of justice.

As the amount of alcohol consumed increases, so does the magnitude of the memory impairments. Large amounts of alcohol, particularly if consumed rapidly, can produce partial (i.e., fragmentary) or complete (i.e., en bloc) blackouts, which are periods of memory loss for events that transpired while a person was drinking. Blackouts are much more common among social drinkers‚Äîincluding college drinkers‚Äîthan was previously assumed, and have been found to encompass events ranging from conversations to intercourse. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of activity in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new auotbiographical memories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"White","given":"Aaron M."}],"citation-key":"whiteWhatHappenedAlcohol2003","container-title":"Alcohol Research & Health","container-title-short":"Alcohol Res Health","ISSN":"1535-7414","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"number":"2","page":"186-196","PMCID":"PMC6668891","PMID":"15303630","source":"PubMed Central","title":"What Happened?

  {"id":"williamsonKnowledgeItsLimits2002","abstract":"Abstract\n            The book develops a conception of epistemology in which the notion of knowledge is explanatorily fundamental. It reverses the traditional programme of trying to analyse knowledge as a combination of truth, belief, and other factors, such as justification. Rather, belief is a state whose successful form is knowledge, and justification is on the basis of knowledge, which is acquainted with evidence. Knowing is as much a mental state as believing, but it is world‚Äêinvolving because one can know only what is true; the book extends the externalist conception of mind from the contents of mental states to the attitudes to those contents. As with other mental states, one cannot always know whether one is in the state of knowing. It is argued that this is a special case of a much more general phenomenon; no non‚Äêtrivial conditions are such that one is always in a position to know that they obtain whenever they in fact do so. This result has disturbing implications for the nature of rationality, because one is not always in a position to know what it is rational to do. Traditional arguments for scepticism fail because they assume that one is always in a position to know what one's evidence is. The speech act of assertion is also governed by a norm of knowledge. A final chapter explores the limits on what can be known that are revealed by the so‚Äêcalled paradox of knowability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Williamson","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"williamsonKnowledgeItsLimits2002","DOI":"10.1093/019925656X.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-925656-3 978-0-19-159867-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",10,10]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressOxford","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Knowledge and its Limits","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/12538"},

  {"id":"winspearGenesisPlatoThought1956","abstract":"It is often said that to understand Plato we must understand his times. Many readers who might accept without question this saying of historical criticism may still wonder why we should think it necessary to begin our enquiry as far back as Homer and beyond. In the case of Plato there is an even greater need to pursue the argument back to the very beginnings of the historical period in which he lived and worked.It is quite impossible to understand the genesis of Plato's ideas without understanding the profound change that Greek society underwent in the post-Homeric period that preceded him. This change in social structure created a mercantile, progressive Greek society, one which laid the foundations for all the subsequent history of Europe and the West. The Genesis of Plato's Thought is particularly highly regarded because it departs vigorously from the traditional abstract, static view of Plato's thought.Winspear's volume on Plato's thought traces, in a realistic fashion, the deep-reaching social and economic roots of Plato's concept of the state and society. Winspear believes that nowhere can the social roots of philosophy be more sharply seen and more firmly apprehended than when one is dealing with the origins of Western philosophy among the Greeks. His book contains the body of information which any reader should have if they wish to approach Plato as a historical figure. To make the book useful to a wide circle of readers, brief biographical identifications for the various important figures of Greek life are introduced in the text.","author":[{"family":"Winspear","given":"Alban"}],"citation-key":"winspearGenesisPlatoThought1956","issued":{"date-parts":[["1956"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"390","publisher":"Russell & Russell","title":"The Genesis of Plato's Thought: Second Edition","title-short":"The Genesis of Plato's Thought","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wollnerCallResponseMusical2020","abstract":"When individuals coordinate their behaviour, they need to both anticipate actions and respond to each other in meaningful ways. Jazz musicians often encounter situations in jam sessions in which they interact with previously unknown musicians, allowing insights into spontaneous collaboration. The current study investigated call and response patterns in free jazz improvisations by analysing movement and musical characteristics of duos. Twelve jazz musicians were paired into six duos of an e-guitar and a saxophone. Balanced across duos, one musician was asked to play a series of improvisations expressing the emotions happy, sad or neutral. The second musician responded to each improvisation without knowing the emotional intention of the first musician. Call and response roles were then exchanged. While musicians improvised or listened to their duo partner, they were both recorded with an optical motion capture system. Results indicate correspondences between call and response musicians in movement variability and cumulative distance of head motion. There were marked differences between happy and sad emotional expressions both in movement parameters and musical features including mean intensity, mode, and, albeit to a lesser extent, tempo. Retrospective verbal decoding of the call musicians‚Äô emotional intentions was correct in 76.5% of all cases. Independently of explicit decoding success and even for the first encounters, musicians spontaneously tuned into each other‚Äôs performances by means of their body movements and the musical characteristics of the improvisations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"W√∂llner","given":"Clemens"}],"citation-key":"wollnerCallResponseMusical2020","container-title":"Musicae Scientiae","container-title-short":"Musicae Scientiae","DOI":"10.1177/1029864918772004","ISSN":"1029-8649, 2045-4147","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"44-59","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Call and response: Musical and bodily interactions in jazz improvisation duos","title-short":"Call and response","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1029864918772004","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"yourgrauDeathNonexistence2019","abstract":"The dead are gone. They count for nothing. Yet, if we count the dead, their number is staggering. And they account for most of what is great about civilization. Compared to the greatness of the dead, the accomplishments of the living are paltry. Which is it then: are the dead still there to be counted or not? And if they are still there, where exactly is \"there\"? We are confronted with the ancient paradox of nonexistence bequeathed us by Parmenides. The mystery of death is the mystery of nonexistence.0A successful attempt to provide a metaphysics of death, then, must resolve the paradox of nonexistence. That is the aim of this study. At the same time, the metaphysics of death, of ceasing to exist, must serve as an account of birth, of coming to exist; the primary thesis of this book is that this demands going beyond existence and nonexistence to include what underlies both, which one can call, following tradition, \"being.\" The dead and the unborn are therefore objects that lack existence but not being. Nonexistent objects - not corpses, or skeletons, or memories, all of which are existent objects - are what are \"there\" to be counted when we count the dead","author":[{"family":"Yourgrau","given":"Palle"}],"call-number":"128.5","citation-key":"yourgrauDeathNonexistence2019","event-place":"New York (N.Y.)","ISBN":"978-0-19-024747-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford university press","publisher-place":"New York (N.Y.)","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Death and nonexistence","type":"book"},

  {"id":"zimmermanMindBodyDualism2011","abstract":"I attempt to rebut Dean Zimmerman's novel argument (2010), which he presents in support of substance dualism, for the conclusion that, in spite of its popularity, the combination of property dualism with substance materialism represents a precarious position in the philosophy of mind. I take issue with Zimmerman's contention that the vagueness of 'garden variety' material objects such as brains or bodies makes them unsuitable candidates for the possession of phenomenal properties. I also argue that the 'speculative materialism' that is available to a substance materialist property dualist who abandons the identification of persons with such garden variety objects is significantly more attractive than Zimmerman allows. Although I do not attempt to refute its substance dualist rival, I conclude that the combination of property dualism with substance materialism can withstand Zimmerman's objections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Zimmerman","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Mackie","given":"Penelope"}],"citation-key":"zimmermanMindBodyDualism2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society","ISSN":"0066-7374","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"181-199","publisher":"The Aristotelian Society","source":"JSTOR","title":"Mind-Body Dualism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41331547","volume":"111"},
