# Notes snippets

- [ ] snippets for text structure:
    - [ ] what's in the reading material:
        - [ ] Type 0: display of an argument
        - [ ] Type 1: explanation of an argument (sub to 1)
        - [ ] Type 2: example of an argument (sub to 1)
        - [ ] Type 3: problem of an argument (sub to 1)
        - [ ] Type 4: answer to problem (sub to 3)
    - [ ] Comments:
        - [ ] From myself/others(lecturer): should be able to be nested, like a dialogue

> Markdown should be the better way because it is more readable, and the content is for myself.
>
> Keep the title short, so Type 0 should not be the title but the content following the title.
> The structure should be like:
>
> ```
> # Argument from XXX
>
> XXX: If such-and-such, then such-and-such.
> ```
