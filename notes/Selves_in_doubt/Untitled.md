About interpretive charity

Upon further thought, my quasi-fictional body view is false. The motivation behind this fictional body view is that, it best explains why Divid not only looks normal, but also thinks he is normal in ordinary life. It's false because the confabulation most of the time does represent some real-life event. 

Subject: Two questions about yesterday's session austere


Hi Prof Hirsch, 

I am writing this email to ask two questions about yesterday's session.

Firstly, in your example of Van Inwagen struggling to decide whether to stay or leave, he cannot leave simply by forming the intention 'Viw should run'. Therefore, the implication appears to be:

1. Viw lacks rational agency in this specific method of intention formation.
2. Noi's method of intention formation is the same as Viw's.
3. Therefore, Noi also lacks rational agency.

However, I think 2 is wrong. There is a difference between Viw's intention formation and Noi's. Viw lacks the capacity pick out 'Van Inwagen' *by acquaintance* and then intend 'Viw! Run!'. (While Viw might recall Van Inwagen from the past by acquaintance, he cannot pick out and intend Van Inwagen now.) Therefore, Viw is unable to form the intention 'Viw should run' at all, given that intention requires acquaintance. In contrast, Noi possesses the capacity for picking out 'Noi' *by acquaintance* and intend 'Noi! Run!'.

Essentially, I believe the core disagreement lies in two distinct conceptions of 'rational agency':

A: An action is performed by a rational agent iff it is caused by an intention formed through rational processes.
B: An action is performed by a rational agent iff it is caused by a *de se* intention formed through rational processes.

My understanding of rational agency leads to A, while I figure you are saying B. (Is this a verbal dispute?) If you are not appealing to anything transcendental, then your argument may have to rely on the assumption that our linguistic community predominantly favors definition B over A.  However, given OpenAI's recent labeling of their new AI models as 'agents,' it is plausible that the semantic scope of 'rational agency' may shift to align more closely with definition A in the future at least.

Secondly, I thought my previous view on Divid's body was too wild and I've abandoned it for good. (I think I'm generally trying to be commonsensical, but intuition tends to lead people to heavy-weight concepts. However, I do want to deflate spooky metaphysics to more light-weight concepts.) But the reason I questioned whether interpretive charity leads us to the speaker's reference is because, intuitively, Sphero may refer to the left hand using a mental representation of it. Because the representation is sometimes confabulation, it seems that Sphero sometimes fails to refer to the whole body, for example, in the experiment. Therefore it seems odd to say Sphero can always refer to Divid.

Best,
Scott
