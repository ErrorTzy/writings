There are three arguments for the thesis that rational agency requires de se attitudes. In this paper, I try to argue that all of them are problematic.

(**Clarification of terms**: Hirsch distinguish between "lower animal rational agency" and "normal human rational agency". In this paper, all "rational agency" refers to "normal human rational agency" in order to *be brief*.)

## The first argument

The first argument, derived from a reading of Perry’s paper, is as follows:

(P1) The de se belief "I am making a mess" is necessary for this particular change in action.
(P2) This particular change in action is analogous to any instance of rational agency with respect to the way of believing.[^1]
(C) Therefore, a de se attitude is necessary for any instance of rational agency.[^2]

Bu (P2) is wrong because, literally any belief that "x is making a mess" can account for a change in action for any individual x. For instance, suppose Berry, not Perry, has a leaking bag of sugar. When Perry discovers that "Berry is making a mess," he would stop chasing Berry, and if Perry is kind enough, he might approach Berry to inform him. Setting aside the mechanics of how Perry stops his leg from chasing someone (which I will discuss in the third argument), nothing hangs on a de se attitude.

We assume it is an instance of rational agency when Perry stops chasing because he realizes he is the one making a mess. By the same token, there is no reason to deny that it is also an instance of rational agency when Perry stops chasing because he realizes Berry is the one making a mess. Thus, the change in action is not analogous to every instance of rational agency with respect to the mode of belief.

To clarify, Hirsch rejects (P2), arguing that Perry’s case merely demonstrates that "a normal human level of rational agency ***very often*** requires a de se attitude." This seems to weaken (P2) to the following:

(P2') The change in action is ***very often*** analogous to any instance of rational agency with respect to the way of believing.
(C') Therefore, a de se attitude is ***very often*** necessary for any instance of rational agency.

However, Hirsch’s own position is (C), not (C'), as he immediately asserts that "rational intentions, plans, and policies at a normal human level ***could not*** enter Noi’s life." Consequently, this form of argument is cannot support Hirsch’s position anyhow.

## The second argument

Of course, one may object that this is not a charitable reconstruction of Perry's argument. The correct argument should be formulated as follows:

(P1) The de se belief that “I am making a mess” is necessary for this particular change in action.  
(P3) If there is an instance of rational agency that someone is incapable of performing, then that person lacks rational agency.  
(P4) Noi is incapable of performing this particular change in action (an instance of rational agency). 
(C) Therefore, a de se attitude is necessary for any instance of rational agency.

The motivation behind this argument is better illustrated by Viw’s case[^3]. However, (P3) immediately requires reformulation because, if accepted as stated, it would imply that Stephen Hawking lacks rational agency. Therefore, we want to restrict (P3) to exclude the cases where people who are incapable to act due to some irrelevant factors. But we cannot just formulate it as follows:

(P3') If there is an instance of rational agency that someone is incapable of performing ***due to the lack of de se attitudes***, then that person lacks rational agency.  
(P4') Noi is incapable of performing this particular change in action (an instance of rational agency) ***due to the lack of de se attitudes***.

Because this would obviously make the argument circular. (P3') and (P4') presupposes that the lack of de se attitude determines and thus explains the the failure of action. But this is just assuming the conclusion. But (P3') and (P4') is exactly what Viw's case is suggesting, and I doubt if there's any reformulation of (P3) that would make this argument sound.

## The third argument

The third argument comes from the newly added text (if OUP allows), which argues from bodily movement. It can be understood as follows:

(P5) All instances of rational agency require agential bodily movement.  
(P6) All agential movements require a de se intention to move a body part _**under the guise of one's own body part.**_  
(C) Therefore, a de se attitude is necessary for any instance of rational agency.

(P5) seems trivial, so (P6) bears the argumentative burden. However, Hirsch provides no justification beyond appealing to intuition and asserting that "it's clear." But I believe the intuition behind (P6) is misled by language. It is natural to describe our intention as "I will raise _**my**_ hand" when we intend to raise our hand. However, in languages where it is more natural to narrate "我要举手 (I will raise hand)" or "手を上げよう (Will raise hand)," this intuition disappears.

One might still resist this debunking and argue that the content of mental intention is inherently the English version, with Chinese and Japanese speakers merely omitting parts for brevity. Once these pragmatic omissions are expanded, the argument goes, the mental content still requires the guise of ***my*** hand in order to act. However, even if we accept this English chauvinism regarding Chinese and Japanese, it does not follow that intention must have de se content.

The first problem is, (P6) presupposes that, we must have some sort of mental representation of our body part in order to act. But an instance of rational agency does not require all bodily movements involved to appear at the conscious level. For example, when you are climbing, you may think, "I must grab that rock tightly in order to go up," and your hand automatically grasps the rock. The fact that your hand does this automatically does not make the whole action any less rational or agential. I believe it's clear that what usually appears to the conscious level in our ordinary life is these high-level actions like "grab that rock." Most people don't play their limbs for fun very often. Therefore, even if, in the case of "I will raise my hand," I must have a mental representation of the hand under the guise of _**my**_ hand, most rational actions do not require such a representation.

The second problem is that there is an unjustified leap from mental activity narration to the mental activity itself. The distinction between de dicto and de re beliefs exists because language per se doesn’t always accurately capture the nature of beliefs. I think that we can generate utterances to talk about objects in the world with two distinct types of mental activities. The first type, often considered internal, involves mental representations—such as descriptions or images—that help us generate utterances. The second type is the understanding of how language functions, which connects to the external world to fix the referent. This second type enables us to consider how others might interpret our words and assists in translating others’ utterances into our own mental representations. For example, when we say the name “Feynman,” we likely rely on a mental image or description (the first type of mental activity) to generate that name. However, as Kripke points out, this mental activity doesn’t fix the referent: Feynman is necessarily Feynman, but no mental image or description inherently provides that necessity. To grasp this necessary connection, we need the second type of mental activity, which helps us recognize that the meaning of the word we use differs from our internal mental representations.

By distinguishing these two types of mental activity, we can see why there is a distinction between de dicto and de re beliefs. The second type isn’t always active, particularly when we’re not communicating with others. As a result, most of our beliefs are de dicto, relying solely on the first type of mental activity.

Here, the key point is that the first type of mental activity may be entirely unrelated to the actual referent. For instance, I might mistakenly believe that Feynman developed the theory of relativity. So, when I narrate my belief as “Feynman is a physicist,” the actual mental activity is that some person who developed the theory of relativity is a physicist. Expressing this in language can seem odd because understanding language activates the second type of mental activity. But this is not necessary when we form beliefs, intentions, or desires. Thus, even when we narrate an intention as “I will raise my hand,” this linguistic structure does not determine the mental activity. As long as only the first type of mental activity is involved, the hand does not have to be represented as the guise of ***my*** hand. It could be just represented as "a controllable hand" or "a familiar hand." 

The third problem with (P6) concerns the possibility of bodily movement. I believe when we were born (or when we were in the womb), we do not yet know which part of the world is our body. Then given (P6), how do we learn to move in the first place? One might argue that infants have some a priori knowledge of their own bodies. I find this claim implausible, but infant psychology is a murky field where firm conclusions are difficult to draw.

However, consider the case of playing a video game through a brain-computer interface. Here, we have no innate knowledge of the controllable "body part," yet we can still learn to control it. If (P6) were correct, we could never control a game character unless we genuinely believed that the character was part of ***me***. But in reality, we can control a game character without identifying it as part of ourselves. (It is plausible to say that it is ***my*** game character, but I believe the "my" here differs from the "my" in "my hand." It is more akin to saying "my pencil," which denotes possession rather than bodily ownership.)




[^1]: By "instances" of rational agency, I mean any action that is produced by whatever process we mean by "exerting rational agency".
[^2]: It is wild to interpret Perry’s paper in this way, though. I believe the most natural reading of Perry’s work is that he argues context-sensitive expressions cannot be replaced by context-insensitive ones. However, Perry does not argue for (C) in his paper. Thus, we should not attribute this argument to him. Nevertheless, let’s set aside the question of attribution and evaluate the argument on its own merits.
[^3]: Viw's case is the case that Hirsch mentioned in class: Viw (Peter van Inwagen) knows who Viw and Thomas Nagel are, and he is one of them, but he has forgotten which one he is now. He also knows that someone is coming for him. If he is Nagel, then a doctor is coming to save him—so staying put is the rational choice for survival. However, if he is Viw, then an assassin is coming to kill him—in that case, running away is the rational option. Viw cannot resolve this predicament by thinking, "Viw should run away and Nagel should stay." In order to act rationally, he must conclude, "I am Viw" or "I am Nagel." But surely, these I-thoughts are not available for Noi.
