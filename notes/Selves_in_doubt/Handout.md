## A No Self Language

### Definition of equivalence

**Definition (useful)**: two sentences are equivalent if relative to any context of utterance, they hold true with respect to the same possible world. 

**Definition (more useful)**: P and Q are equivalent if $\forall World \forall context P \leftrightarrow Q$

**Remark**: A posteriori necessary equivalence does not qualify as "equivalence" in the relavant sense

> H = P?

 
### Miscellaneous

- Reductionism does not imply that the things being reduced to exist
- Saying there's a substantial self is just saying reductionism does not hold

Things being put aside:

- vagueness of equivalence and infinitary sentences
- Statements about personal identity are true by the way we talk. What does that mean?

### Parfit's Stupid Non-self Language

(O) I made the mess

(NS') In the maximal continuous succession of physical and psychological states (events, acts) that contains *this utterance of this sentence*, there is the act of making the mess.

**Proposition 1:** O does not entail NS'.

**Proof**: In the context that I was subconsciously making a mess without thinking or uttering anything, (O) is true but (NS') has no truth value/false.

### Eli's Clever Non-self Language

**Proposition 2:** Proposition 1 holds because the condition for transworld identity does not coincide with the conditions for the transworld identity of successions of person-states.

**Hypothetical Axiom**: $x$ in $W1$ and $y$ in $W2$ are identical if $x$'s properties and $y$'s properties are similar in relevant ways

**Reduction Rule**: Let MCSP be a short-hand for maximal continuouos succession of person-states.

- For $S1$ is a MCSP in $W1$ and $S2$ is a MCSP in $W2$, if the properties of the states in $S1$ and $S2$ has crossworld identity, then $S1$ and $S2$ consitute the same personwise succession.

(O') In that personwise succession of the states (events, acts) that contains the utterance of this sentence, there is the act of making the mess.

**Proposition 3**: O is equivalent to O'
