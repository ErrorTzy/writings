## I

What is the content of our expectation/desire?

- **Option 1**: Miscellaneous objects; particular objects(this cat)/Meinongian incomplete objects(unspecified cat)/proposition
- **Option 2**: Unified Propositional Object

**Defending 2**: There are several advantages of adopting 2

1. Avoid suspicious Meinongian objects
2. Our attitudes are characterized more fully
	- **Example**: If the content of "I want a cat" is a cat, it is still unclear whether I want to be an owner of a cat, or I want to be accompanied by a cat.
3. Explains the causal roles of attitudes better than miscellaneous framework ==why?==

- **Option 3**: Unified properties

Lewis will argue that, *option 3* is better than *option 2* because 

1. it has all the features that *option 2* has, and 
2. sometimes does better than *option 2*

## II proposition vs. property

Definition (proposition)

: A proposition is a set of possible worlds, a region of logical space.

- There are other ways to understand propositions, Lewis does not intend to quarrel with them.
- Possible world semantics has obvious problem, and there are various way to respond. Lewis will ignore the problem for now. We may imagine ourselves talking about hyper-rational creatures who treats all propositions with the same extension as equal.

Definition (property)

: The set of exactly those possible beings, actual or not, that have the property in question.

**Proposition (Correspondence)**: For any proposition $P$, i.e. set of world $W_{P}$, it corresponds a property of *inhabiting in some world $x$ such that $x \in W_{P}$*.

**Hidden Proposition (Symmetry of Correspondence)**: Correspondence is symmetric: If a proposition corresponds with a property, then the property also corresponds with the proposition

**Remark**: The proposition "The snow is white" is a set of world where snow is white. It corresponds with the property of "being in one of the world where snow is white." This property is turn defined as everything in the set of worlds.

**Proposition (Injective Correspondence)**: If a property corresponds to some proposition, it corresponds exactly one proposition

**Proof**: We prove this by reductio. Assume a property $\wp$ corresponds to both $X$ and $Y$, and $X$ is not $Y$. Since $\wp$ is one, $\wp_{X}=\wp_{Y}$. But since $X \neq Y$, $\wp_{X} \neq \wp_{Y}$. Contradiction.

**Remark**: We can understand the correspondence relation as an injective mapping. Let $A$ be the set of all propositions $A$ and $B$ the set of all properties. We have an injective function $f: A \rightarrow B$.

Given this injective relation, we can defend the thesis that, properties can express more things than propositions.

## III propositional belief

**Stage Setting**: 

- When we quantify over the subjects of attitudes, we quantify over subjects spread out in space, time and possible worlds.
- A subject is defined within a world, i.e. their counterparts are not the subject themselves.

Definition (S believes that P)

:  S believe that P means that, S ascribe themselves the property of being in the world that satisfies P

**Example**: Smith believes that cyanoacrylate glue dissolves in acetone means that, Smith is locating himself in one of the world where cyanoacrylate glue dissolves in acetone. That is to say, Smith is ascribing the property of being in some specific world to himself.

**Remark**: Another way to put this is that, S believes that P is for S to locate themselves in the population who lives in the world that satisfies P

## IV de dicto and de se

**John Perry's puzzle**

An amnesiac, Rudolf Lingens, is lost in the Stanford library. He reads a number of things in the library, including a biography of himself, and a detailed account of the library in which he is lost.... He still won't know who he is, and where he is, no matter how much knowledge he piles up, until that moment when he is ready to say, "This place is aisle five, floor six, of Main Library, Stanford. I am Rudolf Lingens."

**Lewis' explanation**:

Reading book will make Lingens believe he is in the world that has some specific structure. But this is not enough. He also ascribe himself some properties of *being in a certain perceptual situation*, which does not correspond with any proposition. By believing a non-propositional belief and a propositional belief, Lingens eventually transformed the propositional belief from book reading to the non-propositional belief about himself.

**Another Example: Two Gods**

Two gods may know every proposition that is true at their world. In so far as knowledge is a propositional attitude, they are omniscient. However, it is still possible that they suffer from ignorance: they cannot tell which one of the two is me.

**Upshot of the example**:

1. They do not lack propositional knowledge
2. They lack knowledge
3. Therefore, they lack non-propositional knowledge

Therefore, sometimes property objects will do and propositional objects won't

Definition (Attitude De Dicto)

: When the content of belief/knowledge/etc has a propositional object, it ha an attitude de dicto

Definition (Attitude De Se)

: Self-ascription of properties is belief/knowledge/etc. with an attitude de se.

**Disagreement with Perry**: Perry makes self-locating vs. Fregean belief distinction. Lewis argues that all beliefs are self-locating. The difference lies in that, *de dicto* beliefs locate oneself in some logical space;  *de se* beliefs locate oneself with respect to ordinary time and space, or with respect to the population.

## V answer to Haecceitists' objection

Let the god in the tallest mountain in world $W$ be called $Tally(w)$, and the god in the coldest mountain in world $W$ $Coldy(w)$. And assume there is a qualitatively identical world $V$, except the gods swap their places. Therefore, $Tally(v)$ is on the coldest mountain, and $Coldy(v)$ is on the tallest mountain. We can draw the following table:

|                         | $W$        | $V$        |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| On the tallest mountain | $Tally(w)$ | $Coldy(v)$ |
| On the coldest mountain | $Coldy(w)$ | $Tally(v)$ |

Haecceitist would would say, the reason why $Tally(w)$ don't know where he is is that, he knows the statement "I am on the tallest mountain" is true at $W$ and false at $V$, but $Tally(w)$ does not know if he is in $W$ or $V$. If $Tally(w)$ knows he is in $W$, then he would know he is on the tallest mountain.

However, this is false. Even if we grant that Tally knows:

1. His is in $W$,
2. "I am on the tallest mountain" is true at $W$ and false at $V$

$Tally(w)$ still does not know where he is. This is because "I am on the tallest mountain" is true when $Tally(w)$ utters it at $W$, but false when $Coldy(w)$ utters at $W$. Since $Tally(w)$ does not know which one is him, he still does not know who he is.

**Remark**: This is due to the indexicality of the word "I"
