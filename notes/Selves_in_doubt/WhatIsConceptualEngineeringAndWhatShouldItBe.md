## What is conceptual engineering

One way to define it: appeal to the definition of engineering and apply it to concepts

Definition (Conceptual Engineering, Informal)

: The process of designing, implementing and evaluating concepts.

**Design stage**: Giving definition, inferential role, paradigm cases, etc
**Implementation stage**: Actually using the concept and get others to use it
**Evaluation stage**: How good these concepts are in themselves and for certain  purposes

- **Objection**: You cannot engineer abstract objects
- **Defense**: Consider software engineering

**Distinction**: 

- Creating an object (concept, bridge, software), vs.
- Fixing/Repairing an object (concept, bridge, software)

**Remark**: The definition may not be necessary and sufficient, but clearly the project of creating and repairing concepts has these three traits.

## Examples of conceptual engineering

**Creating concepts**: supervenience and grounding; Intension, sense, implicature, rigid designator; epistemic injustice; Conceptual engineering
**Fixing concepts**: Amie Thomasson, the notion of existence; Carnap on (explication) Truth, Scharp on truth; Block on consciousness, Chalmers on belief

## De novo conceptual engineering vs. conceptual re-engineering

- **De novo conceptual engineering**: Creating something new
- **Conceptual re-engineering**: fixing something old

Conceptual engineering *should* cover both cases because creating is as important as fixing, though Chalmers thinks it already is because of the definition of engineering and compositionality

- **Example**: Is e-belief belief?
- **Reply**: Yes, because
	1. Words have lexical power, which attaches things
	2. e-belief plays the same explanatory roles as belief
	3. e-belief plays theoretical roles as belief


## Homonymous and Heteronomous Conceptual Engineering

**Homonymous**: Introducing new meaning for old expression. Mostly conceptual re-engineering; Worries about "controlling meaning"
**Heteronomous**: Introducing new words with new meaning, e.g. adding prefix; Worries about "changing subject"

**Strawson's challenge to Carnapian explication**: Carnap is changing the subject

**Remark**: For perfect reasoners, this distinction does not matter at all; But we are not perfect reasoners. They are different in a practical standpoint.

**Remark on homonymous project**: 

- **Upside**: The new concept is easily become associated with the roles relating to the old concepts, like "marriage," "women," etc.
- **Downside**: Theoretically messy, may cause confusion; Hard to implement

## Conceptual Engineering and thesis engineering


**Importance**: Practically: achieving social justice; Theoretically: make a concept more natural and powerful

(Conceptual Engineering is clearly not everything in philosophy because some cases are well enough with old concepts)

**Thesis and Concepts**: New concepts are important because it serves potential roles in certain thesis. E.g. the role of supervenience/grounding for physicalism makes it interesting

**Practical projects**: good seeking, role over thesis
**Theoretical projects**: truth seeking, thesis over role

## Conceptual Engineering and concept pluralism

**Concept Pluralism**: Find a concept that plays different roles and find the concept that play them best

**Remark**: What matters is thesis, because you need thesis to determine roles of concepts. For example, (argue against Sally Haslanger) woman may play the most useful role in a medical context; Generally for a concept pluralist, why not keep old concepts around for different purposes?

## The difficulty of conceptual engineering


**Difficulties**: Designing and evaluating is what philosophers are doing all the time; Implementing is hardest; 

- Challenge from externalism: You need to change use wide enough
- Challenge from changing use: You need to break through social inertia
