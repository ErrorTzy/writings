## Chap 1. Introductory Overview: The Rule of Indexicality, Perspective and the De Se in Philosophy

### 1.1 Perspective and Indexicality: Deep or Shallow?

**Target**: Perspective Essentialism

- *Representationally essential*: perspectivality represent the world in the way that is unavailable with non-perspectival device
- *Metarepresentationally essential*: Many philosophical roles (determining actual world, forming action) can only played by perspectival representation.

### 1.2 Our Target: The Almost Universally Accepted View that Indexicality Is Philosophically Deep

The target is formulated by Perry 1977, 1979 and Lewis 1979.

**Main claim of this book**: There is no such thing as essential indexicals, irreducibly de se attitudes, or self-locating beliefs. Instead of providing a way to reduce them, we claim that they are illusions.
