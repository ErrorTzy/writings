## Chap 1. Introductory Overview: The Rule of Indexicality, Perspective and the De Se in Philosophy

### 1.1 Perspective and Indexicality: Deep or Shallow?

**Target**: Perspective Essentialism

- *Representationally essential*: perspectivality represent the world in the way that is unavailable with non-perspectival device
- *Metarepresentationally essential*: Many philosophical roles (determining actual world, forming action) can only played by perspectival representation.

### 1.2 Our Target: The Almost Universally Accepted View that Indexicality Is Philosophically Deep

The target is formulated by Perry 1977, 1979 and Lewis 1979.

Only anti-Perry-Lewis paper: Millikan 1990 "The Myth of Essential Indexicality"

**Main claim of this book**: There is no such thing as essential indexicals, irreducibly de se attitudes, or self-locating beliefs. Instead of providing a way to reduce them, we claim that they are illusions.

Common ground for contemporary philosophers:

a) Perry and Lewis have succeeded in articulating a clear thesis and the terminology they introduced into philosophical vernacular is well-defined.
b) Perry and Lewis developed (at least) powerful and interesting argument for the thesis of Essential Indexicality.

**The Modest Goal**: Arguments for (a) and (b) are unconvincing, and terms obscure
**The Ambiguous Goal**: Perspective and indexicality is philosophically shallow and play no important explanatory roles in philosophy.

### 1.3 On the Immense Impact of Essential Indexicality: Illustrative Quotes

**Shoemaker 1994**: First-person perspective is important for philosophy of mind
**Van Fraassen 2008, p.88**: Indexicality is important for scientific inquiry
**Ruth Millikan, 1990**: Projecting knowledge of the world into relevant action requires indexical thoughts.
**Colin McGinn 1983, p 91, 104**: Agency is impossible without indexicality
**David Chalmers 1996, p85**: the world *as I find it*; "David Chalmers is me" seems to be a fact not a tautology
**John McDowell 1998**: "Consciousness" is only intelligible in a subjective angle
**David Velleman 2006**: Only first-person maxim can be a maxim of action
**François Recanati 2007b, p243**: Indexical contents are not reducible to non-indexical ones without affecting the cognitive significance
**Susanna Siegel 2011**: Perceptual contents are indexical
**Héctor-Neri Castañeda 1989**: indexical thoughts `I don't know what's happening`

### 1.4 A More Systematic Presentation of Alleged Repercussions of Essential Indexicality Throughout Philosophy

**Philosophy of Language:** Different Accounts

- **Kaplan**: the minimal and conservative one, because it preserves a level of content at which there's no difference between indexical and non-indexical ones
- **Frege**: Everyone is presented to himself in a particular and primitive way
- **Lewis**: Centered-worlds as objects of attitudes, i. e. they are essentially perspectival

**Philosophy of action**: Indexical thoughts are central for rational agency
**Philosophy of perception**: centered-world framework for color perception 
**Metaphysics**: Personal identify and self-consciousness
**Philosophy of religion**: the possibility to survive death
**Formal Epistemology:** Sleeping Beauty problem

### 1.5 More Precise Articulation of Our Target: Essential Indexicality Theses and the Alleged Explanatory Roles of Indexicality

Several claims supports each other:

**Agency**: Ch. 3, Indexicality and de se attitudes plays an essential role in explaining rationalizing action
**Opacity**: Ch. 4, whether the presence of indexicals in opaque contexts raises questions that are fundamentally different from general issues about opacity
**Information**: Ch. 5 and 6, Lewisian thought that indexicality plays an essential role in explanation gathering.
**Epistemic**: Ch. 7, whether immunity to error through misidentification is an essential feature of indexicality (if it is a feature of anything at all)
**Perceptual Content**: Ch. 8, if there is such a thing as perceptual content, then it has to encode the perspective *from which* the perceptual experience is taking place in an indexical manner
**PRO**: Ch. 9, indexical content is essential to the interpretation of PRO constructions

Aim: All of these are false

### 1.6 Basic Kaplanianism and the Goals of This Book

**The content of a sentence**: truth conditional representation of a sentence
**The character of a sentence**: a function maps from context to contents

Motivation for doing this: To isolate the context-sensitive level of meaning

### 1.7 Some of the Many Issues We Will Not Address

Some related topics:

1. Whether there are monsters in Kaplan's sense
2. role of intention in indexical reference fixing
3. interpretation of indexicals used on billboards and answering machines
4. interpretation of indexicals in mixed quotation
5. "know" or "might" is context-sensitive

### 1.8 How to read this book

## Chapter 2 Preliminaries: Language-Mind, Super Indexicals and Opacity

### 2.1 Essential Indexicality: Language or Mind?

**Linguistic indexicality**: The nature of context-sensitive terms
**Conceptual indexicality**: Indexical thoughts

**Problem**: We just take it for granted that beliefs expressed by indexical sentences are immediately indexical. But this move between language and thought is not justified

> Total state of belief at t; representing the total state can be in a lot of ways

How the linguistic framework is developed: the sameness of utterance "I am David Hume" have different truth value. We need to explain what is the same and what is different in these two utterance: the character is the same and the content is different.

But if we move to mental states, we can say the content of the mental states are different. But what is the same? `Character?` If we do not hold a "language of thought" thesis, then it is not clear what is the same. `Fuctional equivalence?`
