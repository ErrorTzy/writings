## Chap 1. Introductory Overview: The Rule of Indexicality, Perspective and the De Se in Philosophy

### 1.1 Perspective and Indexicality: Deep or Shallow?

**Target**: Perspective Essentialism

- *Representationally essential*: perspectivality represent the world in the way that is unavailable with non-perspectival device
- *Metarepresentationally essential*: Many philosophical roles (determining actual world, forming action) can only played by perspectival representation.

### 1.2 Our Target: The Almost Universally Accepted View that Indexicality Is Philosophically Deep

The target is formulated by Perry 1977, 1979 and Lewis 1979.

Only anti-Perry-Lewis paper: Millikan 1990 "The Myth of Essential Indexicality"

**Main claim of this book**: There is no such thing as essential indexicals, irreducibly de se attitudes, or self-locating beliefs. Instead of providing a way to reduce them, we claim that they are illusions.

Common ground for contemporary philosophers:

a) Perry and Lewis have succeeded in articulating a clear thesis and the terminology they introduced into philosophical vernacular is well-defined.
b) Perry and Lewis developed (at least) powerful and interesting argument for the thesis of Essential Indexicality.

**The Modest Goal**: Arguments for (a) and (b) are unconvincing, and terms obscure
**The Ambiguous Goal**: Perspective and indexicality is philosophically shallow and play no important explanatory roles in philosophy.

### 1.3 On the Immense Impact of Essential Indexicality: Illustrative Quotes

**Shoemaker 1994**: First-person perspective is important for philosophy of mind
**Van Fraassen 2008, p.88**: Indexicality is important for scientific inquiry
**Ruth Millikan, 1990**: Projecting knowledge of the world into relevant action requires indexical thoughts.
**Colin McGinn 1983, p 91, 104**: Agency is impossible without indexicality
**David Chalmers 1996, p85**: the world *as I find it*; "David Chalmers is me" seems to be a fact not a tautology
**John McDowell 1998**: "Consciousness" is only intelligible in a subjective angle
**David Velleman 2006**: Only first-person maxim can be a maxim of action
**François Recanati 2007b, p243**: Indexical contents are not reducible to non-indexical ones without affecting the cognitive significance
**Susanna Siegel 2011**: Perceptual contents are indexical
**Héctor-Neri Castañeda 1989**: indexical thoughts `I don't know what's happening`

### 1.4 A More Systematic Presentation of Alleged Repercussions of Essential Indexicality Throughout Philosophy

**Philosophy of Language:** Different Accounts

- **Kaplan**: the minimal and conservative one, because it preserves a level of content at which there's no difference between indexical and non-indexical ones
- **Frege**: Everyone is presented to himself in a particular and primitive way
- **Lewis**: Centered-worlds as objects of attitudes, i. e. they are essentially perspectival

**Philosophy of action**: Indexical thoughts are central for rational agency
**Philosophy of perception**: centered-world framework for color perception 
**Metaphysics**: Personal identify and self-consciousness
**Philosophy of religion**: the possibility to survive death
**Formal Epistemology:** Sleeping Beauty problem
