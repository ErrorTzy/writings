The belief that "I am making a mess" explains that I stopped chasing.
The belief that "That guy in the mirror" does not explain why I stopped chasing.
Why? What standard should a belief meet in order to explain I stopped chasing?

Why de re belief does not explain? Because "it is possible for someone to have a de re belief by looking at the mirror but still chasing"

Premise: If someone has *de se* belief, and they are rational, then they would stop chasing.

Defense: 
Because Perry was trying to chase someone on grounds of the belief that one he was chasing at is *others, but not Perry himself*.
If Perry forms *only* the belief that "someone's sugar bag is leaking", why would Perry start to chase?
It seems that "chasing" already implies a first person knowledge.

Or is it? What if Noi lost his conception of 'I' at $t_0$, but still retains the habit of chasing in this scenario?

But Noi would not form this belief in the first place. Noi can only form the belief that "someone's sugar is leaking".

Why? Can there be a kind of belief that would cause Noi to change his behavior, but we do not intuitively think that Noi would change his behavior on grounds of this belief?

Problem of lower animal: have self-intension but not aware. or have awareness but no self-intention?

The thought of "owing a thought/action" is weird if you cannot identify your body. For example, the particle distance is increased so that everyone have only tiny force on his own body and would cause no notable movement, but together causes some movement.

1. boundary of body is gone
2. no clear control of one's action (i.e. sense of agency)

Can noi feel good/bad without having 'I-thoughts'? "some negative feeling, like pain, is happening" --> "avoiding pain"

Noi cannot have preference? Value judgement? If Noi is hurt, then will Noi do something about it?

We think we initiate our thoughts. Noi thinks thoughts are happening. But Noi do not attribute the thought to himself. Could the two thoughts be identical?

### I-blindness and rational agency

Noi have no rational capacities at a normal human level. Noi cannot be motivated by self-interest.

> Noi may as well feel the force but do not interpret it as "self-interest". Noi may just interpret it as some natural psychological force. For example, when we watch movie, we may plan for the main character 

### The Magic Bullet

KP rule: Subject S refer to S

Y-K objection: KP rule cannot ensure someone to follow it

Eli: Y-K objection does not work because a semantic rule just needs to describe

> why can't Noi just pretend to use it?

Principle of Charity


### Epistemic problems for Noi


#### Indexicals and Demonstratives

'here' means 'where I am', 'that table' means 'the table I am looking at'

> Can't I say Noi can understand it with 'where the speaker is', and learn from others that the speaker is always Noi? Therefore, Noi can use Noi as an anchoring point.

Noi can understand 'that' with a chain of event, therefore an anchoring point is not needed. But Noi cannot reidentify objects without an anchoring point.

> Why can't Noi understand these words in a somewhat homonymous way

#### Mental states

Is it possible for Noi to be able to judge "there is a headache" without being able to judge "I am having a headache"?

Shoemaker: No, because we infer "there is a headache" from "I am having a headache"

Eli: Let's ignore Shoemaker for now. But Noi cannot locate her mental states in a particular body, neither *directly* not *by inference*

> How do we locate our mental states in a particular body?
> We are not infallible in locating it, i.e. phantom limbs; We don't have this knowledge directly (without habit)
> We locate it by sense of agency.

##### Negative states

Noi cannot judge "there is no headache", or she will judge "there is no headache in the universe"

> Why can't Noi judge "there is no headache in the universe", and later she can decide to be a solipsist, or to have some domain restriction. For example, the physical boundary f Noi? No mental state is accessible outside this boundary and all mental states are accessible inside this boundary.

##### Mind-body relation

Since Noi cannot judge "If a body is not situated in a circumstance, then it would not have some experience", Noi cannot generalize when perception do not occur.


### De se and language

Quirrels do not have language. Can they have de se attitudes?

## Chap. 2 The first person pronoun: split brains

Eli is using commonsensical metaphysics

### The three subject view

Official definition of I-blindness:

1. S lacks the capacity to form self-referential I-thoughts in conformity with the KP rule 
2. For any typical mental state M when S is in the state M is is disposed to judge that M occurs

Some I-blind creature can follow KP rule without being self-referential


## Chap. 3 Strange Language of the Self (1): Parfitian Languages

### A no-self Language

**Definition (Reductionism)**: Any sentence describing the identity of a person over time is equivalent to a sentence describing the occurrence of the various (non-branching) physical and (especially) psychological continuities

**Definition (Equivalence)**: $\forall W \forall c \vDash P \leftrightarrow Q)$

This reduction does not follow that the thing reduced to (i.e. single slices in the continuity) exists independently

There is a difference between bilingual and can only speak PF language

## Chap. 5 The impossibility of doubting the existence of other selves

1. **The pride and shame requirement**: A necessary condition for being sane is that one is proud or ashamed of some of one's (physical or psychological) behavior
2. **The comparison requirement**: A necessary condition for being proud or ashamed of one's behavior is that one is proud or ashamed of how one's behavior compares to that of other selves.
3. **The certain requirement**: A necessary condition for being proud or ashamed of how one's behavior compares to that of other selves is that one is certain that there exists other selves to whom one is comparing one's behavior
4. **The sanity principle**: Therefore, a necessary condition for being sane is that one is certain that there exist other selves who have played a role in one's life

**Defense for 3**: "I feel proud that I won the prize, but I feel doubt I won it" seems contradictory. If there cannot feel doubt when one feels proud, then one must feel certain when one feels proud. A remark here: certain here is not a *factive*, i.e. being certain that P does not require that P

> What is "necessary condition"? Maybe the semantics of proud entails being certain
>
>.Maybe being certain is fine-grained? Being certain has contrast class

**Defense for 2**: There is concession here. Eli argues that only central cases have this requirement. What's the ground for a solipsist to say he feels proud about anything? Eli think it is clear that, even if one fails to meet his own expectation, it seems he is just disappointed, not ashamed.

## Chapter 7

If I am sane, I do not doubt;

If I do not doubt, why would I be anxious?

Human "melancholy and delirium": having conflicting attitudes, and thus the epistemic anxiety?

How should we characterize such conflict of belief and doubt?

Frankfurt's frame work: conflicting desire

One can desire *pro tanto* (all things being equal); but we cannot have a *pro tanto* belief ==What's protanto?==

**Strawson's level**: doubt on the level of philosophy, and certain at the level of everyday thinking

About self-deceit:

Clarification 1: this level here is still "first-order" in Frankfurt's sense

Clarification 2: The "really desire" here is not Frankfurt's sense of "really desire": Frankfurt's "really desire" is to identity with the desire. But someone could just really desire something deep down even if with self-deceit he identity himself with the opposite.

Strawson's account would imply that the "philosophical level" is not sane, but this is "barely intelligible" ==Why this is barely intelligible?==

**Broughton's Frankfurtian account**: there are second-order belief and doubt.

The belief-identification principle: Necessarily, you identity with your belief B iff you believe that you have reason f1or the belief B

According to this principle, Hume identity with his doubt; Kierkegaard does not identify with his belief in God. 

But Hume probably does not feel pride and shame for either doubt or certainty. Hume doesn't seem to identify with either.

What's level?

Not independent subject; But must have some internal coherence.

If having attitude A leads to having attitude B, then having A leads to having B in the same level

If you have reason to doubt, then the reason and doubt must be at the same level.
