The belief that "I am making a mess" explains that I stopped chasing.
The belief that "That guy in the mirror" does not explain why I stopped chasing.
Why? What standard should a belief meet in order to explain I stopped chasing?

Why de re belief does not explain? Because "it is possible for someone to have a de re belief by looking at the mirror but still chasing"

Premise: If someone has *de se* belief, and they are rational, then they would stop chasing.

Defense: 
Because Perry was trying to chase someone on grounds of the belief that one he was chasing at is *others, but not Perry himself*.
If Perry forms *only* the belief that "someone's sugar bag is leaking", why would Perry start to chase?
It seems that "chasing" already implies a first person knowledge.

Or is it? What if Noi lost his conception of 'I' at $t_0$, but still retains the habit of chasing in this scenario?

But Noi would not form this belief in the first place. Noi can only form the belief that "someone's sugar is leaking".

Why? Can there be a kind of belief that would cause Noi to change his behavior, but we do not intuitively think that Noi would change his behavior on grounds of this belief?

Problem of lower animal: have self-intension but not aware. or have awareness but no self-intention?

The thought of "owing a thought/action" is weird if you cannot identify your body. For example, the particle distance is increased so that everyone have only tiny force on his own body and would cause no notable movement, but together causes some movement.

1. boundary of body is gone
2. no clear control of one's action (i.e. sense of agency)

Can noi feel good/bad without having 'I-thoughts'? "some negative feeling, like pain, is happening" --> "avoiding pain"

Noi cannot have preference? Value judgement? If Noi is hurt, then will Noi do something about it?

We think we initiate our thoughts. Noi thinks thoughts are happening. But Noi do not attribute the thought to himself. Could the two thoughts be identical?

### I-blindness and rational agency

Noi have no rational capacities at a normal human level. Noi cannot be motivated by self-interest.

> Noi may as well feel the force but do not interpret it as "self-interest". Noi may just interpret it as some natural psychological force. For example, when we watch movie, we may plan for the main character 

### The Magic Bullet

KP rule: Subject S refer to S

Y-K objection: KP rule cannot ensure someone to follow it

Eli: Y-K objection does not work because a semantic rule just needs to describe

> why can't Noi just pretend to use it?

Principle of Charity


### Epistemic problems for Noi


#### Indexicals and Demonstratives

'here' means 'where I am', 'that table' means 'the table I am looking at'

> Can't I say Noi can understand it with 'where the speaker is', and learn from others that the speaker is always Noi? Therefore, Noi can use Noi as an anchoring point.

Noi can understand 'that' with a chain of event, therefore an anchoring point is not needed. But Noi cannot reidentify objects without an anchoring point.

> Why can't Noi understand these words in a somewhat homonymous way

#### Mental states

Is it possible for Noi to be able to judge "there is a headache" without being able to judge "I am having a headache"?

Shoemaker: No, because we infer "there is a headache" from "I am having a headache"

Eli: Let's ignore Shoemaker for now. But Noi cannot locate her mental states in a particular body, neither *directly* not *by inference*

> How do we locate our mental states in a particular body?
> We are not infallible in locating it, i.e. phantom limbs; We don't have this knowledge directly (without habit)
> We locate it by sense of agency.

##### Negative states

Noi cannot judge "there is no headache", or she will judge "there is no headache in the universe"

> Why can't Noi judge "there is no headache in the universe", and later she can decide to be a solipsist, or to have some domain restriction. For example, the physical boundary f Noi? No mental state is accessible outside this boundary and all mental states are accessible inside this boundary.

##### Mind-body relation

Since Noi cannot judge "If a body is not situated in a circumstance, then it would not have some experience", Noi cannot generalize when perception do not occur.


### De se and language

Quirrels do not have language. Can they have de se attitudes?

## Chap. 2 The first person pronoun: split brains

Eli is using commonsensical metaphysics

### The three subject view

Official definition of I-blindness:

1. S lacks the capacity to form self-referential I-thoughts in conformity with the KP rule 
2. For any typical mental state M when S is in the state M is is disposed to judge that M occurs

Some I-blind creature can follow KP rule without being self-referential


## Chap. 3 Strange Language of the Self (1): Parfitian Languages

### A no-self Language

Reductionism: Any sentence describing the identity of a person over time is equivalent to a sentence describing the occurrence of the various (non-branching) physical and (especially) psychological continuities

Equivalent means, given a possible world and context, their truth value remains the same.

This reduction does not follow that the thing reduced to (i.e. single slices in the continuity) exists independently

There is a difference between bilingual and can only speak PF language
