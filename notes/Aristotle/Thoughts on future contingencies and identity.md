Will Leibniz and open future be compatible with each other?

Property P: x win the 2020 election
Past - t<sub>1</sub>
Now - t<sub>2</sub>

Now if we want to say something about Joe Biden, it seems we can formulate three groups of proposition:

Group 1:
1. It is undetermined at t<sub>1</sub> that Biden have P
2. It is true at t<sub>2</sub> that Biden have P

Group 2:
1. It is undetermined that *Biden at t<sub>1</sub>* have P
2. It is true that *Biden at t<sub>2</sub>* have P

Group 3:
1. It is undetermined that Biden have *P at t<sub>1</sub>*
2. It is true that Biden have *P at t<sub>2</sub>*

Leibniz law: If A and B are one and the same thing, then for any true statement of A, it must also be true for B

There is no
