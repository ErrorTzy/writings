> **Question 2: Given that each sense has a category specific special object, how can there be common objects (size, distribution, number, etc.) and a “common sense” for these objects?**

# Intro

Aristotle proposes that we have a common sense for common objects, but hardly gives any argument for it. In this paper, I will reconstruct a view of Aristotle that is more favorable than the inner-sense view.

# What's wrong with common objects?

Obviously, we can realize common objects when we perceive them. Whenever we look at something flat, we automatically realize that it is a flat thing. And afterwards when we try to touch it, we do not think we learn something new when our tactile perception also tells us it is flat. The philosophical question is rather, how can we give an account of this phenomena.

For example, Smith was born blind. But he can still understand flatness by touching some flat objects. However, with the improvement of the technology, one day Smith regained his vision. Then when Smith first sees something flat, will he immediately realize that this is the flatness that he has been touching? Or is he not able to do that? Maybe he will have to build the empirical connection between the flatness by sight and the flatness by touch. There is no internal connection between these two.

Flatness is just one instance that may be picked out by multiple senses. Aristotle defines them as common objects. They include movement, rest, number, figure and magnitude (418a15).

Perhaps the most intuitive way to explain why we realize the common objects is this: We have inner sense and outer sense. The outer sense gives us the raw sensory data. The inner sense structures the data by certain a priori categories. This allows us to comprehend the world not as separate streams of sensations. Therefore the flatness of an object is synthesized by the inner sense through different sensory modalities. 

According to this view, it seems easier to say that Smith will see flatness immediately after he regains his sight. This is because no matter how the sensory data changes, the structure of our inner sense remains the same. The problem with the view is how exactly does Smith's inner sense manage to structure the sensory data, especially since visual experience is completely new to Smith. 

However, Aristotle adopts a different approach of explanation [^1]. He claimed that there is no other sense apart from the five, i.e. sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch (424b20). The common objects are perceived by the five senses, but there is no independent sense organ that is responsible for the common objects. If we adopt this view, then we seem to avoid explaining how the inner sense mysteriously parses sense data into categories. However, a more serious problem immediately follows. For example, my eyes cannot see middle C, and my ears cannot hear colors. If there are only five senses that perceive special objects, then how are common objects still possible? It seems that they are completely separate, and nothing in common can be found in them.

Aristotle explains this by postulating a common sense, while denying that it is not a special sense apart from the five. This tension needs to be explained. What is this common sense? Unfortunately, Aristotle never makes explicit arguments on it, so we need to analyze them from scratch.

# Interpretation of Aristotle's view

According to Aristotle, we perceive common objects incidentally. There is no problem to say that 

1. We see flatness, and 
2. We touch flatness, and
3. The visual and the tactile flatness are one and the same.

Therefore, even if we deny a separate inner sense, we still admit there exists some connection between our tactile and visual perception. This connection of sameness is logically related to its negation: the connection of difference. By this I mean, how do we perceive that whiteness and sweetness differ?

Luckily, Aristotle gives us a more detailed explanation of this problem. Although we see with our eyes, our eyeballs are not the ultimate sense-organ for sight. If they are, then they can still see when we take them out of our bodies. But they cannot. Therefore there is something more to just separately existing bodily organs. In addition, sight is blind to taste and vice versa. But we *are* able to tell that whiteness is different from sweetness. Neither taste nor sight is able to tell this difference. Then what is this thing that seems more to separately existing senses? 

Aristotle explains that it is the unity of our senses. The ultimate sense organ is like an indivisible, holistic receptacle that accepts movements of all kinds. For example, sweetness and whiteness produce simultaneous movement to the receptacle, causing the relevant perceptual experiences. This is possible because sweetness and whiteness are not opposites. One can perceive sweetness and whiteness at the same time. But it is impossible to see a point in vision as both black and white, because they are opposites.

This is an interesting picture of how our perception works. But how does this holistic organ help explain the common objects without collapsing into the separate-inner-sense view? According to Aristotle, the activity of perception is the movement of both the organ and the perceived from potentiality to actuality. The sameness of visual and tactile flatness, then, would come from the sameness of the organ's movement. And the difference between whiteness and sweetness comes from the difference in the organ's movement. Therefore, there is a distinction between common objects and someone who connects some color to middle C. The former is an internal connection derived from the capacity of one's holistic organ, because there are some overlapping movements in sight and touch. The latter is two different movements. However, the borderline of this distinction can be vague, if the capacity of the organ is subject to change .

In order words, the borderline of the distinction between common objects and special objects can be vague, if the capacity is changeable. For example, maybe some radical mutation in the holistic organ will allow us to hear color and see sound. Going back to Smith's case, it depends on whether Smith's perceptual organ still has the capacity to move in ordinary people's way. If he can, then he will immediately realize the sameness of flatness. But the conclusion would ultimately depend on empirical investigation of Smith's holistic organ.

Given this interpretation, I believe it is generally more favorable than the inner sense view. This is because it gets rid of the a priori analysis of categories and the mysterious process of how the internal sense structure the sense data. Instead, it is more compatible with scientific investigation by seeing our brain as a holistic sense organ.
