# Introduction

Plato and Aristotle: different attitude towards ordinary language
Aristotle's analysis comes from ordinary language.

Good life: Platonic or Aristotelian? How much pain can we take?

Modern: explain higher by lower (reduction, maybe from the tradition of atom ism)
Ancient: explain lower by higher

Aristotle:
the organic is more real than the inorganic;

Some basic concepts
1. Form vs. Matter (Rethink what these two are: relative matter? Recursive explanation? What is form? What makes what it is: Function? What is the form of human beings?)
- Distinction of two sense of "in"
- Artificial vs. imitation
2. Potential vs. actual:
    a. Nothing material cannot be fully actual; God is the only fully actual being (such that God has no matter).
    b. All movement is moving from potentiality to actuality: not clock maker fighting clock
3. Substance: everything that depends on but does not depend on anything
4. Four causes

# Categories

Grammatical? Logical? Description of reality; different kinds of being

Kant: thought we impose on the world
Aristotle: the world itself which will impose on our understanding

Tricky problem for Kantian self-reflection: self-reflection is actually hard -- eyes never see eyes

Ryle: Categorical Mistake

Problem of theory of types: kinda self-refuted because ... what is the type of theory of type?

A small book *This is not a pipe* Foucault

Three senses of is:

- Scott is the author of Waverley
- Scott is a democrat
- Scott is/be

Things are going ontological, man!

"in"!

- Spacial "in": Bones are in my hand
- The form of my hand is my hand
- The thought is in me

Is being beautiful most realize beauty or grasping beautiful?

*Strawson, "Individuals", "Subject and predicate and logic in philosophy"*

> Palle: The higher the being, the more it can endure change


*Leon Kiss "the hungry soul"*

DNA

When you eat something, you separate form from matter

We "eat?" people around us and make them similar to ourselves

Good at making babies does not make good baby

Knowledge and the flow of information

Equations are forms. Hoe can "stuff" come into science? How can we understand it theoretically?!!

Matter is potentiality; form is actuality!!

All the fire/intellectual power are forms

Socrates smiles but hardly cries; Jesus cries but hardly smile. Do god take us seriously?

"what is x" reveals the nature of x

> The form of st sometimes is and sometimes is not itself: consider justice and the form of justice

Proper names refer to substance; `question: what is the paradigm of substance?`

**Def 1:** substance is and only is subject

Ordinary grammar vs. reality: Wittgenstein think this is detached; Philosophy is the confusion of language of the world

Simple structure --> mass production Russian tank vs. German tank in the WWII

`Fiction is a world without matter; it is purely form??`

Kripke's theory about proper name is very Aristotelian

**Def 2:** There's no contrary of substance

**Def 3:** There's no more or less of a substance

`contrasting Plato's idea: it seems that someone can be 'more a man' than other, by immitating the form of man?`

**Def 4:** Numerically one and can receive contraries, `that is, it can take on change`

"The unspecified ability of human beings (Aristotle: hand) vs. tigers being strong, fish swims, etc."

Cambridge change(`not genuine change, no change in itself?`): change in relationship

e.g. Proposition's truth value changes, but the fact changes

Frege: proposition cannot change because it is timeless; it must follow a timestamp

# De Interpretatione

Wittgenstein: knowing language is knowing-how; external does not require internal

Is AI **imitation** intelligence or **artificial** intelligence?

How do you know you are conscious/thinking?

Plato’s Cratylus

Fail to refer to, but only refer to now "S at t2"

Negation is syntax and falsity is semantic. When I say ¬P, I'm not saying P is false (say? Or give?)

Is assertion a hidden negation? E.g. "The room is full" is short for "the room is not empty"?

Is assertion always stating something true?

> Palle: No, I'm only asserting some truth value
> What???????????????????

word-word relationship is syntax
word-world relationship is semantic
word-speaker relationship is pragmatics

Is non-contradiction syntactic or semantic?
**Is excluded middle syntactic or semantic?**
> Palle: it's syntactic

Every sentence only has one truth value.

Inside circle and everything outside the circle

Truth is correspondence with reality

But what reality?

> Palle: reality is a Swiss cheese. There are holes in it.

**Bivalence(every sentence has a truth value; there's no 'undetermined' truth value) is false?**

> Consider the difference between three-value logic and truth-gap theory.

Do thoughts require language?

Chomsky generative grammar; language is our cerebral stuff

Reading a book: the book is determined

Sea battle problem

Necessary: unavoidable

Pass wasn't necessary then, but is necessary now.

If something is true, then it is a fact; and a fact cannot be otherwise/altered --> What is true is always true.

Are predictions talking about facts? Is reality confined till present? Consider Parmenides: being be

Even if hard determinism is true, it would not have any impact on our life

Aristotle's solution: 
Solution 1: For future, neither P and ¬P is true.
Problem: is P∨¬P true?
What is necessarily is when it is and what is necessarily is when it is not.
Necessarily (everything is or is not); e.g. It is necessary that (either sea battle happens or not)
But what makes this very statement true?

> ? Proposition are timeless, but its truth value can change from none/undetermined to true or false; once it has been assigned a value, it cannot change.

> The hard point is, if we want to give an account for future tense that has no truth value, we meanwhile should not pay the price of destroying sentences in past tense. 

> Yeah! Consider birthday. Is birthday real? It is a future necessity?

# Physics

God seems to be the most knowable thing by us?

> Yourgrau:
> clearly clear: slavery is wrong
> clearly unclear: abortion
> Palle: You comes from not existing. An object comes from being non-existing to existing. There is some substratum

If your car is completely nonfunctional, and you put it into the garage, then the car will cease to exist even if it looks the same.

> Palle: Theory of being: three categories, existence, non-existence and being. Being is a Parmenides' being. (but being is one?)

If there is a vagueness between A and B, should we say A is B?

> If you make a whole wheat sandwich. Could it have been made with white bread?

Paradoxical nature of Aristotelian form-matter distinction: it preserve our intuition about matter, but its actually form doing the trick.

The philosophy of change: from one state to the opposite of the state;
This also applies to existence.

Is the statue *in* a piece of marble? 
Plato: yes `?`
Aristotle: No you created a new substance/object

When you change, the opposite property goes into non-existence.

F comes to be F from ¬F.

For Aristotle, reality is substance.

Form does not yearn nothing/does not desire anything --> desire for completion

It's the matter that does the yearning; they yearn to be actualized `Palle: This is completely Platonic`

Sexual love is the confused Eros; This happen when you cannot grasp the higher/complete yourself to the higher; but anyway all Eros are divine

**Artificial** being has less potential; Natural things has internal principle of grow and decay.

What is the true nature? What are nature kinds?

What defines a artificial thing is its function.

Gazing vs. Eating: plants do not exist by destroy but gazing; we exist by destroying. `Not really accurate!`

De Anima: The soul is dependent/separate entity? No, the soul is the form of the body (transcendent vs. immanent)

Detour:

Holding child pornography without raping child without publishing/drawing a painting of killing Trump/drawing child porn without publishing is a crime or not?

Can holding a thought/planning a crime/holding pornography be illegal?

Thought/Intention: Plato talking about intention

Da Vinci: he really know something when he draws. He's not just imitating, but really know the structure of the body, etc..

## Form and Matter

Matter is **relative!!** to something, because matter can also be form. E.g. matter relative to body is cells, but cells are made of atoms, etc.. 
Matters **are not necessarily material**. Letters are matter of words.

In Plato's Pheado: how do soul trap in the body?
Palle: by illusion. The soul thought it is the body. Mathematics is an important drawing force for Platonism. Other aspects about the world draws us away from Plato.

## Four causes

What is the root of Mathematics? If you don't know it, then you are not a knower. You are only an engineer of mathematics.

Formal, Material, Efficient, Final Cause

No one can understand a watch/violin/clothes`/any other artificial stuff` if we have no final cause.

Question: what about the final cause of numbers?

Formal Cause: The essence is *not* the thing itself, but the formal cause of it.

Four causes of human:
Efficient Cause: sexual intercourse
Formal Cause: Human nature
Material Cause: sex cells
Final Cause: ? Ethics?

Final cause is not something that produce anything. The neck of giraffe is not PRODUCED by the purpose of eating leafs.

> Maybe teleology is similar to emerging property when the scale rises?

The notion of QUA in Aristotle is important

"Potential" is a mode of being.

> Palle: Potential energy disappear when you fill the ground...how?
> Quantum mechanics is where potential cannot be reduced to actual.

## Change

Def: Actualization of potential qua potential

## Infinity

Infinity is potential not actual.

> Problem: it cannot be actualized.
> Also, this is a temporal account. But if this is so, you cannot use this temporal account to explain time.

God is not infinite because god is completely actual, but infinity is completely potential.

> Aristotle and Plato's god does not give a shit to human
> Palle: Even if I love Beethoven, Beethoven do not give a shit to me
> A lot of person do not have the courage to love someone who do not love them back;

## Numbers

Aristotle thinks numbers are not objects, unlike Plato.

## Time

Book IV, Ch. 10-11

Einstein: transforming time to geometry (time is eternal)

> What would happen if time starts to go backwards now? Will we even be able to tell?

Time is not consistent of "now"s

Time is the number of change.

> Palle: this is what clock does: it convert "change" into numbers

# De Anima

We can separate form and matter in thought, but not in reality

> Plato: there's something x that is harmed by vice but not by being destroyed.
> E.g. You cannot destroy a number; You can destroy a painting, but you cannot destroy the beauty of a painting
> You cannot harm the soul, but Socrates did not say soul cannot be destroyed
>
> That, for Plato, separates the soul and the body. Aristotle wants to give us a different picture.

Aristotle: The soul is the form of the body. Form and matter are two aspects of the same thing.
> Problem: the body is not matter

> Problem: Is the form more realized in the entity itself, or the theory of the form?
> e.g. Is the soul more realized in myself, or when someone is understanding me?

The soul in the body is the substantial form, not the appearance form. The appearance only make me look like me. The substantial form makes me.
