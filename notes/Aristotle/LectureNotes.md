# Introduction

Plato and Aristotle: different attitude towards ordinary language
Aristotle's analysis comes from ordinary language.

Good life: Platonic or Aristotelian? How much pain can we take?

Modern: explain higher by lower (reduction, maybe from the tradition of atom ism)
Ancient: explain lower by higher

Aristotle:
the organic is more real than the inorganic;

Some basic concepts
1. Form vs. Matter (Rethink what these two are: relative matter? Recursive explanation? What is form? What makes what it is: Function? What is the form of human beings?)
- Distinction of two sense of "in"
- Artificial vs. imitation
2. Potential vs. actual:
    a. Nothing material cannot be fully actual; God is the only fully actual being (such that God has no matter).
    b. All movement is moving from potentiality to actuality: not clock maker fighting clock
3. Substance: everything that depends on but does not depend on anything
4. Four causes

# Categories

Grammatical? Logical? Description of reality; different kinds of being

Kant: thought we impose on the world
Aristotle: the world itself which will impose on our understanding

Tricky problem for Kantian self-reflection: self-reflection is actually hard -- eyes never see eyes

Ryle: Categorical Mistake

Problem of theory of types: kinda self-refuted because ... what is the type of theory of type?

A small book *This is not a pipe* Foucault

Three senses of is:

- Scott is the author of Waverley
- Scott is a democrat
- Scott is/be

Things are going ontological, man!

"in"!

- Spacial "in": Bones are in my hand
- The form of my hand is my hand
- The thought is in me

Is being beautiful most realize beauty or grasping beautiful?

*Strawson, "Individuals", "Subject and predicate and logic in philosophy"*

> Palle: The higher the being, the more it can endure change


*Leon Kiss "the hungry soul"*

DNA

When you eat something, you separate form from matter

We "eat?" people around us and make them similar to ourselves

Good at making babies does not make good baby

Knowledge and the flow of information

Equations are forms. Hoe can "stuff" come into science? How can we understand it theoretically?!!

Matter is potentiality; form is actuality!!

All the fire/intellectual power are forms

Socrates smiles but hardly cries; Jesus cries but hardly smile. Do god take us seriously?

"what is x" reveals the nature of x

> The form of st sometimes is and sometimes is not itself: consider justice and the form of justice

Proper names refer to substance; `question: what is the paradigm of substance?`

**Def 1:** substance is and only is subject

Ordinary grammar vs. reality: Wittgenstein think this is detached; Philosophy is the confusion of language of the world

Simple structure --> mass production Russian tank vs. German tank in the WWII

`Fiction is a world without matter; it is purely form??`

Kripke's theory about proper name is very Aristotelian

**Def 2:** There's no contrary of substance

**Def 3:** There's no more or less of a substance

`contrasting Plato's idea: it seems that someone can be 'more a man' than other, by immitating the form of man?`

**Def 4:** Numerically one and can receive contraries, `that is, it can take on change`

"The unspecified ability of human beings (Aristotle: hand) vs. tigers being strong, fish swims, etc."

Cambridge change(`not genuine change, no change in itself?`): change in relationship

e.g. Proposition's truth value changes, but the fact changes

Frege: proposition cannot change because it is timeless; it must follow a timestamp

# De Interpretatione

Wittgenstein: knowing language is knowing-how; external does not require internal

Is AI **imitation** intelligence or **artificial** intelligence?

How do you know you are conscious/thinking?

Plato’s Cratylus

Fail to refer to, but only refer to now "S at t2"

Negation is syntax and falsity is semantic. When I say ¬P, I'm not saying P is false (say? or give?)

Is assertion a hidden negation? E.g. "The room is full" is short for "the room is not empty"?

Is assertion always stating something true?

> Palle: No, I'm only asserting some truth value
> What???????????????????

word-word relationship is syntax
word-world relationship is semantic
word-speaker relationship is pragmatics

Is non-contradiction syntactic or semantic?
**Is excluded middle syntactic or semantic?**
> Palle: it's syntactic

Every sentence only has one truth value.

Inside circle and everything outside the circle

Truth is correspondence with reality

But what reality?

> Palle: reality is a Swiss cheese. There are holes in it.

**Bi valence(every sentence has a truth value; there's no 'undetermined' truth value) is false?**

> Consider the difference between three-value logic and truth-gap theory.

Do thoughts require language?

Chomsky generative grammar; language is our cerebral stuff

Reading a book: the book is determined

Sea battle problem

Necessary: unavoidable

Pass wasn't necessary then, but is necessary now.

If something is true, then it is a fact; and a fact cannot be otherwise/altered --> What is true is always true.

Are predictions talking about facts? Is reality confined till present? Consider Parmenides: being be

Even if hard determinism is true, it would not have any impact on our life

Aristotle's solution: 
Solution 1: For future, neither P and ¬P is true.
Problem: is P∨¬P true?
What is necessarily is when when is and what is necessarily is when it is not.
Necessarily (everything is or is not); e.g. It is necessary that (either sea battle happens or not)
But what makes this very statement true?

> ? Proposition are timeless, but its truth value can change from none/undetermined to true or false; once it has been assigned a value, it cannot change.

> The hard point is, if we want to give an account for future tense that has no truth value, we meanwhile should not pay the price of destroying sentences in past tense. 

> Yeah! consider birthday. Is birthday real? It is a future necessity?
