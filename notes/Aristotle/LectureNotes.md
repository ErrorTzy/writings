# Introduction

Plato and Aristotle: different attitude towards ordinary language
good life: Platonic or Aristotelian? How much pain can we take?

Modern: explain higher by lower (reduction)
Ancient: explain lower by higher

Aristotle:
the organic is more real than the inorganic;

Some basic concepts
1. Form vs. Matter (Rethink what these two are: relative matter? Recursive explanation? What is form? What makes what it is: Function? What is the form of human beings?)
- Distinction of two sense of "in"
- Artificial vs. imitation
2. Potential vs. actual:
    a. Nothing material cannot be fully actual; God is the only fully actual being (such that God has no matter).
    b. All movement is moving from potentiality to actuality: not clock maker fighting clock
3. Substance: everything that depends on but does not depend on anything
4. Four causes
