## Part One: Reasons

### 1. Normative Concepts

> Eli: Parfit is looking for a action related concept that is parallel to reason vs evidence for belief. But there's highly likely that there's no such concept. 

#### 1 Normative Reasons
##### **Reasons**: fundamental

**I have reason X to do Y**
: X is a reason for doing Y if and only if X is a reason for doing Y, even if we are not aware of it.

**I have more reason to do Y**
: The reasons for doing Y is stronger/outweights the reasons for doing Z.

**X is a decisive reason**
: X is stronger than our reasons to act in any other way.

**X is strongly decisive reason**
: X is *much* stronger than other conflicting reasons.

**X is a sufficent reason**
: X is not weaker than reasons for acting in any other way.

##### **Rationality and "ought to"**: defined in terms of reason

**We ought do Y**
: When X is an *decisive reason* to do Y, we *should* do Y.

**Doing Y is rational**
: We have beliefs whose truth would be *sufficient reason* to do Y.

**We ought rationally to do Y**
: We have beliefs whose truth would be *decisive reason* to do Y.

**Doing Y is less than fully rational**
: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *clear and decisive reason* NOT to do Y.

**Doing Y is irrational**
: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *strongly decisive reason* NOT to do Y.

In other words, whether we ought to do something depends on reason giving facts; Whether it is rational to do something depends on our belief.

Is following the reasons given by beliefs sufficient for our action being rational?

1. Do the beliefs also need to be rational?
2. Other rational requirements, like not to have contradictary intentions, beliefs, etc.? Later give some argument against the sufficiency of these requirements

**Motivating reason**
: The belief that provides reason for an action, could be false

**Normative reason**
: The fact that, if correctly believed, would provide reason for an action

The sense of normativity is not of morality: If I want to catch the train, and I believe that if I don't leave now, I will miss the train, then I ought rationally to leave now. This is not what I ought morally to do. It is possible that we have no reason to do what we are morally required to do. What "ought to" means here simply appears to be irrelavant to morality.

#### 2. Reason-Involving Goodness
##### **Good**: Defined in terms of reasons

**x is good**
: there are certain *facts about x* that would in certain situations *give us reason* to respond to this thing in some positive way (e.g. wanting, choosing, using, producing, etc.)

> This already seems to define goodness as a relational property between facts and us. If so, then different people would have different goodness.

**x is intrinsically good**
: x makes our lives worth living

**x is instrumentally good**
: x has effects that are intrinsically good for us

**x is good for us**
: x is in our well-being

**self-interested reason**
: reasons to care about our own well-being

**altruistic reason**
: reasons to care about the well-being of other people

**partial/person relative reason**
: reasons to care about the well-being of people who are related to us in some way

**impartial reason**
: reasons to care about the well-being of whatever that person's relation to us

**x is good for someone**
: x gives this person self-interested reason and give other people altruistic reason for the sake of that person

**x is better (in the impartial-reason-implying sense) than y**
: everyone would have strong reason to want x to occur rather than y from an impartial point of view

**Upshot**: The concept of "good" or "good for" is defined in terms of giving us reason, and therefore not fundamental.

> Different types of reasons: teleological? factual?

### 2. Objective Theories

#### 3. Two Kinds of Theory

**Two senses of "want to x"**

The wider sense of want
: Any state of being motivated to do x (if s does x willingly, then s wants to do x)

The narrower sense of want
: Being disposed to make x happen (if s is attracted by x itself, then s wants to do x)

> What Parfit means seems to be: when we say we want x, we may not know what x exactly is, like "I want to do what you want me to do": I know how to fix x, but I don't know what x is. Therefore, the narrow sense of "want to x" is that, "x itself provides me with motivation", which arguably requires me to know what x exactly is; the wider sense is "something about x, not x itself, provides me with motivation." It seems the difference is just, whether we are motivated to do x by some property intrinsic to x, or external to x.

**psychological egoism**:

1. Whenever people act, they are doing what they want to do
2. Doing what we want is selfish
3. Therefore, whenever people act, they are acting selfishly

**Parfit's objection**: This argument fails because the "want to x" in premise 1 is in the wider sense, while the "want to x" in premise 2 is in the narrower sense: if I do what I want to do in the broader sense, I wouldn't be acting selfishly. 

Desire
: A psychological state that has *events* as content: we want to drink water instead of wanting water, so what we want is always some event.

Telic desire
: If we want some event as an end, instead of wanting it for the sake of something else, then it is a telic desire.

Instrumental desire
: If we want1 some event for the sake of something else, then it is an instrumental desire.

Aim
: The object of a telic desire is called our aim.

**psychological hedonists**: All telic desires are desires for pleasure and avoidance of pain.

**Parfit's objection**: this confuses the *pleasure of fullfilling a desire* with *the object of the desire*. If I want posthumous fame, even if I may gain pleasure from thinking about it, I work hard for the sake of fame, not pleasure.

> My comment: Given my subjectivist position, psychological hedonism is obviously false because it presupposes how other minds work.

Two views on Practical Reasons:

**Objectivists about reasons**
: There are some facts such that these facts are reasons for our desires or aims; These partucluar facts are called "object-giving reasons"

**Subjectivists about reasons**
: Reasons are all provided by facts taking the following form: Doing x would fulfill our present desires or aims (or the desires or aims we would now have if we had carefully considered all the relevlant facts)

(P. 59: the Telic Desire Theory: We have most reason to do whatever would best fulﬁl or achieve our *present* telic desires or aims.)

**Difference between objectivism and subjectivism about reasons:** Though objectivists can agree that, the facts taking the form "Doing x would fulfill our present desires" are reasons, these reasons, according to objectivists, derive their force from the facts that give us reason to have these aims (desires). But subjectivists think there's no such fact of the matter that can make desires or aims rationally preferable to others.

> They are in tention because objectivists can say telic desires are irrational; Subjectivists do not think desires can be irrational; Eli is a moderate objectivist in the sense that, some desires can give reasons and some desires can't

#### 4. Responding to Reasons

**Practical Reasons**: A fact can be a reason for (1) the mental state of wanting x to happen, and (2) the behavior of doing something to make x happen

**Responding to a reason by action vs. Responding to a reason by having desire**: The former is always volaruntary, the latter is not always voluntary. We can choose to act in some way, but we cannot choose to want in some way.



> The Telic Desire Theory, according to Parfit, only consider our PRESENT desire; It does not take future desires into account.
