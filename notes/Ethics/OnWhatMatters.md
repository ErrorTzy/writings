## Part One: Reasons

### 1. Normative Concepts

> Eli: Parfit is looking for a action related concept that is parallel to reason vs evidence for belief. But there's highly likely that there's no such concept. 

To eli: I think you admitted earlier that it's not fully rational to do way 3 when you have 5 ways to walk down the street; So I think what Parfit mean by "rational" is what you mean by "fully rational". And what you mean by "rational" somewhat cut through Parfit's terminology: it's neither "rational", not "less-than-rational". Arguably it's something in between.

#### 1 Normative Reasons
##### **Reasons**: fundamental

I have reason X to do Y
: X is a reason for doing Y if and only if X is a reason for doing Y, even if we are not aware of it.

I have more reason to do Y
: The reasons for doing Y is stronger/outweights the reasons for doing Z.

X is a decisive reason
: X is stronger than our reasons to act in any other way.

X is strongly decisive reason
: X is *much* stronger than other conflicting reasons.

X is a sufficent reason
: X is stronger or equal to reasons for acting in any other way.

##### **Rationality and "ought to"**: defined in terms of reason

We ought do Y
: When X is an *decisive reason* to do Y, we *should* do Y.

Doing Y is rational
: We have beliefs whose truth would be *sufficient reason* to do Y.

We ought rationally to do Y
: We have beliefs whose truth would be *decisive reason* to do Y.

Doing Y is less than fully rational
: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *clear and decisive reason* NOT to do Y.

Doing Y is irrational
: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *strongly decisive reason* NOT to do Y.

In other words, whether we ought to do something depends on reason giving facts; Whether it is rational to do something depends on our belief.

Is following the reasons given by beliefs sufficient for our action being rational?

1. Do the beliefs also need to be rational?
2. Other rational requirements, like not to have contradictary intentions, beliefs, etc.? Later give some argument against the sufficiency of these requirements

Motivating reason
: The belief that provides reason for an action, could be false

Normative reason
: The fact that, if correctly believed, would provide reason for an action

The sense of normativity is not of morality: If I want to catch the train, and I believe that if I don't leave now, I will miss the train, then I ought rationally to leave now. This is not what I ought morally to do. It is possible that we have no reason to do what we are morally required to do. What "ought to" means here simply appears to be irrelavant to morality.

#### 2. Reason-Involving Goodness
##### **Good**: Defined in terms of reasons

x is good
: there are certain *facts about x* that would in certain situations *give us reason* to respond to this thing in some positive way (e.g. wanting, choosing, using, producing, etc.)

> This already seems to define goodness as a relational property between facts and us. If so, then different people would have different goodness.

x is intrinsically good
: x makes our lives worth living

x is instrumentally good
: x has effects that are intrinsically good for us

x is good for us
: x is in our well-being

self-interested reason
: reasons to care about our own well-being

altruistic reason
: reasons to care about the well-being of other people

partial/person relative reason
: reasons to care about the well-being of people who are related to us in some way

impartial reason
: reasons to care about the well-being of whatever that person's relation to us

x is good for someone
: x gives this person self-interested reason and give other people altruistic reason for the sake of that person

x is better (in the impartial-reason-implying sense) than y
: everyone would have strong reason to want x to occur rather than y from an impartial point of view

**Upshot**: The concept of "good" or "good for" is defined in terms of giving us reason, and therefore not fundamental.

> Different types of reasons: teleological? factual?

### 2. Objective Theories

#### 3. Two Kinds of Theory

**Two senses of "want to x"**

The wider sense of want
: Any state of being motivated to do x (if s does x willingly, then s wants to do x)

The narrower sense of want
: Being disposed to make x happen (if s is attracted by x itself, then s wants to do x)

> What Parfit means seems to be: when we say we want x, we may not know what x exactly is, like "I want to do what you want me to do": I know how to fix x, but I don't know what x is. Therefore, the narrow sense of "want to x" is that, "x itself provides me with motivation", which arguably requires me to know what x exactly is; the wider sense is "something about x, not x itself, provides me with motivation." It seems the difference is just, whether we are motivated to do x by some property intrinsic to x, or external to x.

**psychological egoism**:

1. Whenever people act, they are doing what they want to do
2. Doing what we want is selfish
3. Therefore, whenever people act, they are acting selfishly

**Parfit's objection**: This argument fails because the "want to x" in premise 1 is in the wider sense, while the "want to x" in premise 2 is in the narrower sense: if I do what I want to do in the broader sense, I wouldn't be acting selfishly. 

Desire
: A psychological state that has *events* as content: we want to drink water instead of wanting water, so what we want is always some event.

Telic desire
: If we want some event as an end, instead of wanting it for the sake of something else, then it is a telic desire.

Instrumental desire
: If we want some event for the sake of something else, then it is an instrumental desire.

Aim
: The object of a telic desire is called our aim.

**psychological hedonists**: All telic desires are desires for pleasure and avoidance of pain.

**Parfit's objection**: this confuses the *pleasure of fullfilling a desire* with *the object of the desire*. If I want posthumous fame, even if I may gain pleasure from thinking about it, I work hard for the sake of fame, not pleasure.

> My comment: Given my subjectivist position, psychological hedonism is obviously false because it presupposes how other minds work.

Two views on Practical Reasons:

Objectivists about reasons
: There are some facts such that these facts are reasons for our desires or aims; These partucluar facts are called "*object-given reasons*"

Subjectivists about reasons
: Reasons are all provided by facts taking the following form: Doing x would fulfill our present desires or aims (or the desires or aims we would now have if we had carefully considered all the relevlant facts)

(P. 59: the Telic Desire Theory: We have most reason to do whatever would best fulﬁl or achieve our *present* telic desires or aims.)

**Difference between objectivism and subjectivism about reasons:** Though objectivists can agree that, the facts taking the form "Doing x would fulfill our present desires" are reasons, these reasons, according to objectivists, derive their force from the facts that give us reason to have these aims (desires). But subjectivists think there's no such fact of the matter that can make desires or aims rationally preferable to others.

> They are in tention because objectivists can say telic desires are irrational; Subjectivists do not think desires can be irrational; Eli is a moderate objectivist in the sense that, some desires can give reasons and some desires can't

#### 4. Responding to Reasons

**Practical Reasons**: A fact can be a reason for (1) the mental state of wanting x to happen, and (2) the behavior of doing something to make x happen

**Responding to a reason by action vs. Responding to a reason by having desire**: The former is always *volaruntary*, the latter is not always *voluntary*. We can choose to act in some way, but we cannot choose to want in some way.

The free choice to be made: which desire we are trying to fulfill. 

> The Telic Desire Theory, according to Parfit, only consider our PRESENT desire; It does not take future desires into account.

#### 5. State-Given Reasons

| Category     | Telic and Intrinsic                                                | Instrumental                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| object-given | The event that we want would be in itself good, or worth achieving | Our wanting this event would be in itself good   |
| state-given  | *Our wanting this event* would be in itself good                   | *Our wanting this event* would have good effects |

There is a parallel in beliefs: some reasons for believing are related to the truth of the proposition; Some reasons for believing are related to the pragmatic goodness of our believing.

**Parfit's comment**: It's not worth claiming that there's such state-given reasons

#### 6 Hedonic Reasons

Intrinsic telic reason
: The feature of the object of the desire that is worth achieving is intrinsic to the object of the desire.

Extrinsic telic reason
: The feature of the object of the desire that is worth achieving is extrinsic or relational to other events.

> Translation: If some intrinsic feature of some events should trigger our desire, then it's intrinsic telic reason.

> Difference between extrinsic telic reason and instrumental reason: The former is about the object contituting the goodness of a sequence of events, the latter is about causing the occurrence of a desirable event.

Different objective theories disagree on which kinds of facts gives us intrinsic telic reasons


Different objective theories also disagree on whose well-being we should care about.

- **Rational Egoism**: We only have reasons to promote our own well-being
- **Rational Impartialism**: We have reasons to promote everyone's well-being

(Parfit thinks none of these is correct)

Desire-like states
: The states that are like desires, but they are not reponses to reasons, like hunger, thirst and lust

Hedonic likings and dislikings
: They are about *actual*, *present* sensations
: these likings or dislikings of some of our sensations make these sensations pleasant, painful or unpleasant.

**Examples**: We may like or dislike the taste of a food, or touching velvet, etc. But these are neither rational or irrational. These states only have causes, not reasons. 

> Parfit is giving way to subjectivists about likings and dislikings: they can be responses to some facts, but these facts are not reasons but merely causes.

Meta-hedonic desires
: The desire of some states

**Difference between meta-hedonic desires and the dislike of a state**: 

1. desires can be fulfilled: if one desire a state, the desire is fulfilled by continuing to have it or ceasing to dislike it; But likes or dislikes cannot be fulfilled or unfulfilled.
2. Desires can aim at something not actual and not present; Like or dislike can only aim at present actual states

**Korsgaard**: something can be 'objectively good as an end because it is desired for its own sake'

**Parfit's objection**: Korsgaard's argument did not distinguish desire and dislike. Our liking something can make conscious states good or bad, but our desires can't.

#### 7. Irrational Preferences

Rational desires
: If the feature of the object of our desires are reasons for wanting them, then the desire is rational

Irrational desires
: If we desire some event contrary to reasons, then the desire is irrational

**Example**: Tuesday indifference is irrational; Similarly, baise towards the near is irrational

### 3. Subjective Theories

#### 8. Subjectivism about Reasons

Desire-Based Theory
: We have a reason to do whatever would fulfill any of our present desires.

## 6. Morality

### 19 Sidgwick's Dualism

Morality is not defined by reasons, though it may largely depend on reasons.

Reasons are different from moral obligations

impartial reasons = impartial reasons apart from moral obligations

**Rational Egoism**: We always have most reason to do whatever would be best for ourselves.

**Rational Impartialism**: We always have most reason to do whatever would be impartially best.

**the Dualism of Practical Reason**: We always have most reason to do whatever would be impartially best, unless some other act would be best for ourselves. In such cases, we would have sufﬁcient reasons to act *in either way*. If we knew the relevant facts, either act would be rational.

**Defense for the dualism**:Two Viewpoints argument

A.  When we try to decide what we have most reason to do, we can rationally ask this question either from our own personal point of view or from an imagined impartial point of view.
B.  When we ask this question from our personal point of view, the answer is that self-interested reasons are supreme.
C.  When we ask this question from an impartial point of view, the answer is that impartial reasons are supreme.
D.  To compare the strength of these two kinds of reason, we would need to have some third, neutral point of view.
E.  There is no such point of view.

**Parfit's stance**: Dialism is right, but the argument is unsound. (A) is wrong because 

According to Sidgwick’s Dualism, in contrast, impartial and self-interested reasons are wholly incomparable: they can't be stronger or weaker than another

**Wide Dualism**: When we are choosing between two morally permissible acts, of which one would be better for ourselves and the other would be better for one or more strangers, we could rationally either 

- give greater weight to our own well-being, or 
- give roughly equal weight to everyone’s well-being.

> Eli: This definition is based on the premise that we are *putting aside moral obligations*

The opposite of rationality is craziness; The opposite of morality is not following rules. One can desire X while commit oneself to not do X.
