## Part One: Reasons

### 1. Normative Concepts

Parfit's way of talking

- **I have reason X to do Y**: X is a reason for doing Y if and only if X is a reason for doing Y, even if we are not aware of it.
- **I have more reason to do Y**: the reasons for doing Y is stronger/outweights the reasons for doing Z.

- **X is a decisive reason**: X is stronger than our reasons to act in any other way
- **X is strongly decisive reason**: X is *much* stronger than other conflicting reasons
- **X is a sufficent reason**: X is not weaker than reasons for acting in any other way

- **We ought do Y**: When X is an *decisive reason* to do Y, we *should* do Y.
- **Doing Y is rational**: We have beliefs whose truth would be *sufficient reason* to do Y
- **We ought rationally to do Y**:  We have beliefs whose truth would be *decisive reason* to do Y
- **Doing Y is less than fully rational**: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *clear and decisive reason* NOT to do Y
- **Doing Y is irrational**: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *strongly decisive reason* NOT to do Y

In other words, whether we ought to do something depends on reason giving facts; Whether it is rational to do something depends on our belief.

Is following the reasons given by beliefs sufficient for our action being rational?

1. Do the beliefs also need to be rational?
2. Other rational requirements, like not to have contradictary intentions, beliefs, etc.? Later give some argument against the sufficiency of these requirements

- **Motivating reason**: the belief that provides reason for an action, could be false
- **Normative reason**: the fact that, if correctly believed, would provide reason for an action

The sense of normativity is not of morality: If I want to catch the train, and I believe that if I don't leave now, I will miss the train, then I ought rationally to leave now. This is not what I ought morally to do. It is possible that we have no reason to do what we are morally required to do. What "ought to" means here simply appears to be irrelavant to morality.

2. Reason-involving goodness

**x is good**: there are certain facts about x that would in certain situations give us reason to respond to this thing in some positive way (e.g. wanting, choosing, using, producing, etc.)
