## Part One: Reasons

### 1. Normative Concepts

> Eli: Parfit is looking for a action related concept that is parallel to reason vs evidence for belief. But there's highly likely that there's no such concept. 

#### **Reasons**: fundamental

- **I have reason X to do Y**: X is a reason for doing Y if and only if X is a reason for doing Y, even if we are not aware of it.
- **I have more reason to do Y**: the reasons for doing Y is stronger/outweights the reasons for doing Z.

- **X is a decisive reason**: X is stronger than our reasons to act in any other way
- **X is strongly decisive reason**: X is *much* stronger than other conflicting reasons
- **X is a sufficent reason**: X is not weaker than reasons for acting in any other way

#### **Rationality and "ought to"**: defined in terms of reason

- **We ought do Y**: When X is an *decisive reason* to do Y, we *should* do Y.
- **Doing Y is rational**: We have beliefs whose truth would be *sufficient reason* to do Y
- **We ought rationally to do Y**:  We have beliefs whose truth would be *decisive reason* to do Y
- **Doing Y is less than fully rational**: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *clear and decisive reason* NOT to do Y
- **Doing Y is irrational**: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *strongly decisive reason* NOT to do Y

In other words, whether we ought to do something depends on reason giving facts; Whether it is rational to do something depends on our belief.

Is following the reasons given by beliefs sufficient for our action being rational?

1. Do the beliefs also need to be rational?
2. Other rational requirements, like not to have contradictary intentions, beliefs, etc.? Later give some argument against the sufficiency of these requirements

- **Motivating reason**: the belief that provides reason for an action, could be false
- **Normative reason**: the fact that, if correctly believed, would provide reason for an action

The sense of normativity is not of morality: If I want to catch the train, and I believe that if I don't leave now, I will miss the train, then I ought rationally to leave now. This is not what I ought morally to do. It is possible that we have no reason to do what we are morally required to do. What "ought to" means here simply appears to be irrelavant to morality.

2. Reason-involving goodness

#### **Good**: Defined in terms of reasons

**x is good**: there are certain *facts about x* that would in certain situations *give us reason* to respond to this thing in some positive way (e.g. wanting, choosing, using, producing, etc.)

> This already seems to define goodness as a relational property between facts and us. If so, then different people would have different goodness.


- **x is intrinsically good**: x makes our lives worth living
- **x is instrumentally good**: x has effect s that are intrinsically good for us
- **x is good for us**: x is in our well-being

- **self-interested reason**: reasons to care about our own well-being
- **altruistic reason**: reasons to care about the well-being of other people
	- **partial/person relative reason**: reasons to care about the well-being of people who are related to us in some way
	- **impartial reason**: reasonsn to care about the well-being of whatever that person's relation to us

- **x is good for someone**: x gives this person self-interested reason and give other people altruistic reason for the sake of that person.
- **x is better (in the impartial-reason-implying sense) than y**: everyone would have strong reason to want x to occur rather than y from an impartial point of view

**Upshot**: The concept of "good" or "good for" is defined in terms of giving us reason, and therefore not fundamental.

> Different types of reasons: teleological? factual?

### 2. Objective Theories

#### 3. Two Kinds of Theory

Two senses of "want to x"

- The wider sense: Any state of being motivated to do x
- The narrower sense: Being disposed to make x happen

> What Parfit means seems to be: when we say we want x, we may not know what x exactly is, like "I want to do what you want me to do": I know how to fix x, but I don't know what x is. Therefore, the narrow sense of "want to x" is that, "x itself provides me with motivation", which arguably requires me to know what x exactly is; the wider sense is "something about x, not x itself, provides me with motivation." It seems the difference is just, whether we are motivated to do x by some property intrinsic to x, or external to x.

**psychological egoism**:

1. Whenever people act, they are doing what they want to do
2. Doing what we want is selfish
3. Therefore, whenever people act, they are acting selfishly

**Parfit's objection**: This argument fails because the "want to x" in premise 1 is in the wider sense, while the "want to x" in premise 2 is in the narrower sense: if I do what I want to do in the broader sense, I wouldn't be acting selfishly. 

- The object of our desire: an event
- Aim: Some desires are instrumental, and is for the sake of something else; The telic desire is our aim.

**psychological hedonists:** All telic desires are desires for pleasure.

**Parfit's objection**: this confuses the pleasure of fullfilling a desire with the object of the desire. If I want posthumous fame, even if I may gain pleasure from thinking about it, I work hard for the sake of fame, not pleasure.

**Objectivists about reasons**: Desires or aims has objects (facts); These facts are reasons.
