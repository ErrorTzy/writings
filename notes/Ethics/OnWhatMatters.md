## Part One: Reasons

### 1. Normative Concepts

Parfit's way of talking

- **I have reason X to do Y**: X is a reason for doing Y if and only if X is a reason for doing Y, even if we are not aware of it.
- **I have more reason to do Y**: the reasons for doing Y is stronger/outweights the reasons for doing Z.
- **X is a decisive reason**: X is stronger than our reasons to act in any other way
- **X is strongly decisive**: X is *much* stronger than other conflicting reasons
- **X is a sufficent reason**: X is not weaker than reasons for acting in any other way
- **We should do Y**: When X is an *decisive reason* to do Y, we *should* do Y.
- **Doing Y is rational**: If we have beliefs whose truth would be *sufficient reason* to do Y, then doing Y is rational.
