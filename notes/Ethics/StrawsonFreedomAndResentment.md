| Some          | Don't know what determinism is                                                                                                            |
| Pessimists    | If determinism is true, then punishing and blaming are unjustified.                                                                      |
| Optimists     | Even if determinism is true, punishing and moral blaming can still be justified.                                                         |
| Moral skeptics| Notions like blame, guilt and moral responsibility are inherently incoherent. Therefore, determinism is irrelevant to moral responsibility. |
