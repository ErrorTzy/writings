conventionalism ve anti-conventionalism in the debate of how promises generates obligations.

**Scanlon**: anti-conventionalism

**standard view**: distinctive way for binding us; THE answer to why should I do it; Obligation must be something internal, and related to our actions

Kantian challenge: if you lost the motive, then you are not obliged to do it

Kant starts from presupposing the sense of morality.

**Challenge 2**: why the cultivated moral venerance is different from the cultivated commitment to a sport team? And what about random conventions? Is it also the same as moral obligation? It seems our intuitions are different. What explains the difference.


## I. 

### Explication of Jorah's view

**Jorah-Kant disagreement**: 

1. What explains an action/person being good?
2. Why we feel bounded by morality? Where does the force come from?

- **Kant**: 

	- Acting out of categorical duty
	- A priori arguments gives *normative force*

- **Jorah**: 

	- Acting out of socially established rules, and the rules come out of the roles that we play in social practices; 
	- Our sensibilities and feelings gives *normative force*

> On the sort of view I prefer, a person’s sense of obligation can instead be thought of in terms of her relation to certain ==socially established rules==, which tell her what she must, may, or cannot do in certain sorts of situations, through ==defining *offices, positions, and roles* in terms of *the privileges, powers, and responsibilities* that attach to them==. These rules help constitute what are often called _social practices_.
> 
> Rather, I think we do better to locate ==the roots of our sense of moral bondage== in our complex capacity for ==sensibility or feeling==. 

According to Jorah, when I feel moral bondage, it comes from some complex psychological facts, like my feeling.

> In particular, the sort of motive ==I think we should cultivate and prize reflects what we might characterize as a felt sense of the crucial importance to human social flourishing of certain among our practices==, as expressed centrally (though by no means exclusively) in a person’s being moved to follow strictly and strenuously the rules that constitute those practices.

But immediately, Jorah lists a moral bondage *for us all*, regardless of *my* feeling about it. According to Jorah, *we* are obliged to "cultivate the sense of the importance of human social flourishing". (This seems to be another way to say, we should be bounded by the following goal: making human society flourish. If someone does not feel in this way, we should make them feel this way.)

Does this come out of *Jorah*'s personal feelings? But if so, then why *Jorah*'s specific personal feeling binds *us* all? It can't be. The policy that "we should cultivate the sense of the importance of human social flourishing" needs further justification. What justification could it be?

Given what is said later, Jorah seems to be giving a claim about out *actual* society. According to the current paradigm case of our society, we should cultivate the sense of the importance of human social flourishing.

**Jorah-Hume disagreement**

- **Hume**: Some unity for the feeling that gives us moral bondage: approbatory sentiment
- **Jorah**: The kind of feelings that give us moral bondage has no unity; It's family resemblence at best. There are only paradigm instances.

> Unlike these philosophers, I tend to think what we call morality is much messier and less unified—more like a loosely associated constellation of concepts, distinctions, norms, practices, feelings, motives, and so forth, connected to one another by relations of family resemblance and history at best.

The sort of emotion that binds us to morality must be artificially cultivated, and there is no unity of this kind of emotion; And what exactly should we cultivate depends on our psychology, history and social conventions.

> The sort of motivation we prize when, for instance, a woman of her word tells an uncomfortable truth or keeps a difficult promise, is one that must be acquired, cultivated, and refined.
> Moreover, the operation of such motives in us is ==sensitive to our reflection upon the nature, history, and social value, of living together== as people characteristically moved in these familiar ways.

### Target

**Target (kantian) objection**: When our other *values or interests* (which is given by our cultivated feelings and sentiments from social practices, according to Jorah) disagree with *moral rules* (which is understood from established social practices, according to Jorah), only unconditional authority (of moral rules) can determine the motivation for us to act; The "humean-style" nomativity cannot decide how to act coherently when they disagree with each other, causing a "normative failure"

> [!Remark]
> Example: sorites paradox: according to the intuitive rules we follow, no matter how many grains of sand is not a heap. But this is immediately absurd.

**Jorah's defense**: Following moral rules does not automatically give us motivation to act; The motivation of following rules come from "the urgency of adherence to the practice that moves her to comply." Saying that rules always trump is just worshipping. "Moral failure" is an attractive feature, not a bug

## II.

A good account of obligation is an account that fits the way we actually think and act

> A good “account” of obligation earns its keep, in other words, by speaking to us as people faced with figuring out how to think, feel, and act where we encounter the concept

- **Kantians**: Use morality and obligation for action, with Kantian semantics
- **Insurgent Moralists**: Do away the concept of morality and obligation altogether
- **Jorah**: We should make use of "morality" and "obligation" in our action, but with better semantics

> For those who, like me, are distrustful of the idea that moral obligation should be understood in those terms, but not ready to do away with the concept altogether, we need to think through other, more attractive ways of seeing our obligations.

## III

### The humean sense of obligation

Humean story of obligation:

1. Our own interoughest leads to cooperation
2. Cooperation creates rules (promises and properties); We comply with the rules because we think it's beneficial
3. The motivation for complying such rules *transformed* into a sense of justice and fidelity, which is utterly un-self-interested

**Problem**: how is this fictional story related to our actual motivation of action?

**Answer 1 (Rawls)**: The story gives justification for the authority; Here, when we say some X justifies an action A when X offers an agent sufficient reason to act A. But it seems giving this story does not give sufficient reason

> The claim that "it gives no sufficient reason" comes out of our actual intuition?

**Answer 2 (Jorah)**: The story explains that, why we *do not need a justification* in order to be motivated to an obligation. The explanation is that, we are *actually* already cultivated into having this motivation. Only those who are not cultivated in this manner may need a justification. The Humean story is a good enough ethical theory because it count as an abduction for how we get hold of this veneration. (i.e. We already have the veneration; Human make us understand why we have it, from the inside how motives can be transformed)

> The justification for an action does not be "intellectual", but just "unthinking acquiescence"?

### The implication for the humean sense of obligation

Consider the question: *Why should I do P?*

What count as a proper answer to this question?

**Kantian**: 

- An answer qualifieoughs as *correct* only if the answer it appeals to the legitimacy of rules

**Jorah**: 

- The Kantian requirement is wrong because (1) it makes no sense to distance ourselves from our commitment to some rule and ask why the rule/role is right, and (2) it is hard to see why we would be motivated by such an answer
- The right answer can be: "because of the following fact: I am cultivated into having the veneration to follow the rule"; And this is further clarified by the rationale of having this motive: I am cultivated into following rules, like keeping promise, because of (1) my own "economical motivation" (i.e. as *homo economicus*); And (2) I want to simulate the kind of partial relations with our intimates 

> [!Remark]
> The first criticism against the Kantians is a kind of Carnapian view: It makes no sense to ask what we should do if we strip away the veneration for the rules in question, and ask why follow the rule/role. -- But this seems to presuppose we cannot meaningfully answer why we follow the rule/role without stripping away the veneration for rules. 
> The second criticism against the Kantians is to attack the problem of why we are bounded by the correct answer. 
> Jorah's answer of why obligation is binding is that, we actually have the veneration for the rules, given the Humean story. So Jorah is saying, the is-ought gap is closed by our actual motivation: we ought to do something because we are already commited to them. And we are already commited to them because of some humean story: we transformed some of our clear commitment, like our inclination to be economical and our desire for intimacy, to the moral commitment to some rules.

> Rather, what we are shown is how and why the motives in question are precisely the sort of thing that we cannot but see as integral to our own ethical outlook. And it is for this reason that asking, ==Why should _I_ keep _my_ promises==? and meaning by the question that one would be satisfied only by a showing of ==the legitimacy of the rules==, so as to establish the ultimate correctness of one’s own motive to comply with them ==makes little sense==. We would have to imagine that a person might somehow ==“distance” herself completely from her veneration for the rules in question, and then query the basis of their right to play the role== they do from some point of view outside of an ethical life defined partly in their terms. But this assumes what simply is not true on this view—even supposing that any meaningful question of _that_ form might be raised, it is fundamentally ==unclear what relevance any answer could have for us== as we in fact are _viz_. people who pride ourselves in being (or striving to be) people of our word, and who therefore would be distasteful, if not altogether unrecognizable, to ourselves if we lacked such a motive.

## IV

### The process of deliberation

- **Kantian picture**: Figure out one's real obligation --> know how to act
- **Jorah's picture**: Figure out one's obligation (which is the commitment to rules) --> Find out whether one should obey the obligation --> know how to act

### Brake's argument that marriage vow cannot be promise:

**First argument**:

1. If one has a valid moral obligation to $\phi$, then one will be subject to moral blame if not $\phi$
2. One is not subject to moral blame if not following the marriage vow (by unilateral divorce)
3. Therefore, a marriage vow is not a moral promise

**Second argument**:

1. One can only have a moral obligation to do what is under one's direct, voluntary control
2. Marriage vow is not made under one's direct voluntary control (because of affection, loyalty and love)
3. Therefore, one cannot have a moral obligation to keep a marriage vow

**The problem**: People do feel they are bounded by the vow. The Kantian way out is to say this is an "empty delusion" what is not a real obligation

### Jorah's Alternative

Marriage is an obligation because we have the motivation to follow it; But what it can mean to be morally bound, in Jorah's sense?

**Against the first argument**

Brake must reject the following thought:

- If one's spouse breaks their vow, then one should not (rationally) feel being morally wronged. (i.e. one should not blame their spouse morally)

But this thought should not be rejected. We can say the lesson is that, not blaming someone morally is not everyone's buisiness.

**Against the second argument**

The upshot would be, a lot of promises will come out not having obligation
