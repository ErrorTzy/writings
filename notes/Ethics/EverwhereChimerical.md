**Jorah-Kant disagreement**: 

1. What explains an action/person being good?
2. Why we feel bounded by morality? Where does the force come from?

- **Kant**: 
	- Acting out of categorical duty
	- A priori arguments gives *normative force*
- **Jorah**: 
	- Acting out of socially established rules, and the rules come out of the roles that we play in social practices; 
	- Our sensibilities and feelings gives *normative force*

> On the sort of view I prefer, a person’s sense of obligation can instead be thought of in terms of her relation to certain ==socially established rules==, which tell her what she must, may, or cannot do in certain sorts of situations, through ==defining *offices, positions, and roles* in terms of *the privileges, powers, and responsibilities* that attach to them==. These rules help constitute what are often called _social practices_.
> 
> Rather, I think we do better to locate ==the roots of our sense of moral bondage== in our complex capacity for ==sensibility or feeling==. 

According to Jorah, when I feel moral bondage, it comes from my feeling.

> In particular, the sort of motive ==I think we should cultivate and prize reflects what we might characterize as a felt sense of the crucial importance to human social flourishing of certain among our practices==, as expressed centrally (though by no means exclusively) in a person’s being moved to follow strictly and strenuously the rules that constitute those practices.

But immediately, Jorah lists a moral bondage *for us all*, regardless of *my* feeling about it. According to Jorah, *we* are obliged to "cultivate the sense of the importance of human social flourishing". (This seems to be another way to say, we should be bounded by the following goal: making human society flourish. If someone does not feel in this way, we should make them feel this way.)

Does this come out of *Jorah*'s personal feelings? But if so, then why *Jorah*'s specific personal feeling binds *us* all? It can't be. The policy that "we should cultivate the sense of the importance of human social flourishing" needs further justification. What justification could it be?

May be this relies on the fact that, we are already growing up in a society where we are cultivated to have this emotion. Therefore, we already have the emotion that binds us to care for human social flourishing.

**Jorah-Hume disagreement**

- **Hume**: Some unity for the feeling that gives us moral bondage: approbatory sentiment
- **Jorah**: The kind of feelings that give us moral bondage has no unity; It's family resemblence at best. There are only paradigm instances.

The sort of emotion (the instances) must be artificially cultivated. Are the paradigm instances conventional?

> The sort of motivation we prize when, for instance, a woman of her word tells an uncomfortable truth or keeps a difficult promise, is one that must be acquired, cultivated, and refined.
