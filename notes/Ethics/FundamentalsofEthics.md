## Chap. 19 Moral Relativism

### 19.1 Doubts about objective morality

**Moral nihilism**

~ There are no moral truth at all, all moral talk are either false or disguised way of venting our feelings

**Ethical Relativism**

~ Some moral standards really are correct, and these make moral talk true.
~ But these moral standards are correct relative to person or society because a person or a society is committed to it.

### 19.2 Two Kinds of Ethical Relativism and Their Attractions

**Two variants**: *cultural relativism* and *individual relativism(ethical subjectivism)*.

**Subjectivism**

~ An act is morally acceptable iff (a) I approve of it, or (b) My commitments allow it;
~ An act is morally wrong iff (a) I disapprove of it, or (b) My commitments forbids it

**Cultural relativism**

~ An act is morally acceptable iff the guiding ideal of the society allows it;
~ An act is morally wrong because the guiding ideal of the society forbids it

**Negative Motive**: Criticism of ethical objectivism, see ch. 21

**Positive Motive**: 

1. Easily explains the origin of morality: human attitudes
2. Why morality is restricted to human beings: Because this is human invention
3. A scientific account: there's nothing mysterious about morality, nothing over and above personal/cultural taste
4. The possibility of moral knowledge: Knowing your/the society's commitments
5. Egalitarian: There are no moral specialist, no one is superior

### 19.3 Some implications of Ethical Subjectivism and Cultural Relativism

#### Moral Infallibility

**Problem for CR**: If a social code can be wrong without contradicting with other more important social ideals, then CR is in trouble.

- **Example**: "honor killing" in Istanbul, killing a woman after being raped because the honor of a family is dirtied.

> What if the girl accepts?

**Problem in general**: Moral principles are infallible. Therefore it can be correct even if they are based on prejudice, ignorance, superficial thinking or brainwashing. This seems hard to accept.

> Is it really hard to accept? This is not a knock-down argument.

#### Moral Equivalence

**Problem for Subjectivism**: The moral outlooks of Hitler are just as plausible as those of a Nobel Peace laureate

**Problem in general**: Every society' ideals are equally good. No one is better than another.

> Can there be a unconditional, absolute framework?

#### Questioning Our Own Commitments

**Problem for subjectivism**: It is possible and even normal to question whether my commitments are right or not. But according to subjectivism, once I know my commitments I know the truth.

**Problem in general**: It seems that you cannot ask further whether the society's values are correct

> Does relative truth follow that you can't disagree or don't like it?

#### Moral Progress

**Problem**: If moral claims cannot be wrong, then there cannot be moral progress.

> Why is this a problem? Can't we say that, if we adopt $t_1$'s standard to $t_0$, then we can say that it improved? 

#### Ethical Subjectivism and the Problem of Contradiction

**Problem (moral disagreement)**: A says "Abortion is permissible" and B says "Abortion is impermissible", therefore they must be contradicting with each other. But according to the theory, these two sentences are both truth. But a theory cannot generate two true sentences that contradicts each other. Therefore the theory must be false.

- **Defense**: When we say "Abortion is false," we are just abbreviating "I disapprove abortion"
	- **Objection 1**: People do not think they are saying this
	- **Objection 2**: Moral disagreement would be impossible.

> One way to produce moral disagreement is to say "I disapprove abortion, and I think everyone else should." The problem, however, is to explain the "should" here. Maybe we can translate it as "I disapprove abortion, and I disapprove whoever approves abortion"

#### Cultural Relativism and the Problem of Contradiction

**Problem (multicultural member)** Apart from the disagreement problem that has already mentioned, CR also faces problem when someone is a member of two cultures, and their ethical clashes, your action is both moral and immoral. 

- We cannot appeal to the superiority of a culture: According to CR all systems are equal. 
- We cannot appeal to personal choice: CR will collapse into subjectivism.

> Why it is a contradiction? It is both moral relative to $C_1$ and immoral to $C_2$. What's the problem with this?

### 19.4 Ideal Observers

A natural way to fix relativism is to posit an ideal observer: We want to make sure whoever creates the moral law is reasoning clearly and avoiding logical errors.

Definition (Ideal Subjectivism)

: An act is morally right iff I would favor it were I fully informed and perfectly rational

Definition (Ideal CR)

: An act is morally right iff the society would favor it were all members fully informed and perfectly rational

**Advantage of the idealized versions**:

1. No longer infallible
2. No longer equivalent, some are closer to the ideal
3. We can question our own commitments by asking whether it is really ideal
4. There can be moral progress by approaching the ideal
5. There can be real disagreement, i.e. disagreement on ideal observer's stance

**Problem of the idealized versions**:

- **Objection 1**: There cannot be any disagreement at all between two fully rational and informed ideal observers.
	- **Defense**: Maybe there are different sets of axioms are both rational, like ZFC and HoTT. We can say that, whatever all ideal observers agrees are morally required; disagreed morally prohibited; things disagreed permitted because it is neither required nor prohibited.
- **Objection 2**: There's no guarantee that the ideal observer is sympathetic or kind. Therefore, it is possible for an ideal observer to think killing off the mentally ill is right.
- **Objection 3**: According to all these view, nothing is good or bad in itself, but because something else thinks it's good or bad. But this goes back to Euthyphro dilemma: 
	- if people decide good or bad arbitrarily without reason, it seems hard to accept; 
	- if people decide good or bad based on reason, then it's the reason, not the person, explains why something is good or bad. 
	It seems that relativism is confusing the evidence and the cause: the ideal observer's (dis)approval is the evidence, not the cause of something being good or bad.

> Why can't we say that it can be arbitrary or based on psychology, rather than reason? And can I argue that the reason must in turn appeal to some web of belief of the ideal observer?

## Chap. 20 Moral Nihilism

A rigid *fact-value distinction*; Since value is not factual, it cannot be true.

Two important forms: *Error theory* and *expressivism*

### 20.1 Error Theory

#### The Theory and Its Attractions

1. There are no moral features in the world. Nothing is morally good or bad.
2. No moral judgments are true because there is nothing for them to be true of.
3. There is no moral knowledge because knowledge requires truth.
4. Our sincere moral judgments try and fail to describe the moral feature of things.

**Analogy**: Error theory is to morality as atheism is to religion.

Like atheism needs to show that there is an error at the heart of religious belief; Error theory needs to show that *there is an error at the heart of morality*. To do that, we need first identity what fundamental error is supposed to be. 

**The core mistake**: Just like atheists think religion crucially depends on the supernatural, morality essentially depends on its being objective, i.e. it applies to us regardless of what we want.

If this is the right diagnosis, then we need to prove:

1. buying into morality does assume a commitment to *moral objectivity* and *categorical reasons*.
2. at least one of the assumption is false

**Attractions**

1. a very simple, pared-down view of reality
2. Does not need to explain objective morality or categorical reasons

### Two mistaken Objections

**Argument from Disastrous Results**: 

1. If widespread acceptance of a view would lead to disastrous results, then that view is false
2. Widespread acceptance of the error theory would lead to disastrous result
3. Therefore, the error theory is true

- **Objection**: Premise 1 is strikingly false. The truth of a theory does not depend on whether people adopting it or not.
- **Defense 1**: I can adjust (1) into: If widespread acceptance of a view would lead to disastrous results, then that view is *immoral*
	- **Objection to 1**: This is also false. If everyone ere to practice celibacy, then disaster would ensue. That doesn't show that it is immoral to be celibate.
- **Defense 2**: I can adjust (1) into: If widespread acceptance of a *moral theory* would lead to disastrous results, then that view is false
	- **Objection to 2**: Error theory is not a moral theory, but a metaphysical theory

**Ad hominem attack**: error theorists are untrustworthy because only people who believe moral duties are real can be trusted.

- **Objection**: Error theorists can behave morally by thinking of acting as distasteful; The only problem for them is that it is not guaranteed. But buying morality does not guarantee people to be moral. Many atrocities happen in the name of morality.

The right way to attack: attack the assumptions error theorists made in 20.1

### 20.2 Expressivism

Expressivism accepts the three propositions mentioned in error theory:

1. There are no moral features in the world. Nothing is morally good or bad.
2. No moral judgments are true because there is nothing for them to be true of.
3. There is no moral knowledge because knowledge requires truth.

But they rejects the fourth, namely:

4. Our sincere moral judgments try and fail to describe the moral feature of things.

When we are making moral judgments, we are not describing the world. But instead, we are venting our emotions, commanding others to act or revealing a plan of action.

**Attraction**:

1. Explains contradiction and moral disagreement: there's no contradiction to say A is good and A is bad, but there's moral disagreement due to the clash of emotions
2. Simplicity: There's no extra layer of reality
3. Explains why moral judgments motivates us: because moral judgments are expressing the things that would motivate us to act. i.e. desires, cares, commitments, etc, instead of beliefs.

#### How is it possible to Argue Logically about Morality?

**Problem**: A valid proof is when all the premises are true guarantees that the conclusion is truth. But if no moral judgments has truth value, how are we supposed to do any derivations?

**Example**:

1. All actions that dehumanize people are immoral
2. Torture dehumanizes people
3. Therefore, torture is immoral

#### Expressivism and Amoralists

Definition (Amoralist)

: An amoralist is someone who sincerely makes moral claims but is entirely unmoved by them.

If expressivism is correct, then someone cannot sincerely believe he ought to do X but completely unmotivated to do X.

> What does "completely unmotivated" even mean?

#### The Nature of Moral Judgment

There are some hard translations for expressivism, e.g.

- Nobody but Jeff knows how to behave when the boss is around
- I'm not sure whether torture is ever acceptable, but I am sure that those who are wiser than I am have the correct answer
- ...

Even if we can translate it into some complex structure, it is prima facie implausible to say that we are intended to utter these sentence to mean them. It seems that when we are expressing moral claims, we are expressing beliefs instead of speech act.
