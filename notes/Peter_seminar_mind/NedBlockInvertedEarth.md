Block's position: 

- FOR qualia realism, though accept functionalism as one aspect of our mind
- AGAINST through-going functionalism

## The Fallacy of Intentionalizing qualia

A distinction needed for the hypothesis of inverted spectrum:

- **intentional content**: the way the experience represent the world
- **qualitative content**: what the experience is like

**Block's theorem**: If inverted spectrum is possible, then experiential contents that can be expressed in public language are intentional contents

**Proof**: By reductio. Assume experiential contents that can be expressed in public language are qualitative contents; And assume "red" has a public meaning that both of us use. If so, then it is impossible for us to have different qualitative content given that we agree "it is red" is true. However, according to the assumption that inverted spectrum is possible, then it must be possible for us to have different qualitative content even if we agree "it is red" is true.

> I will deny that, if we really use language in this way, the word still have a public meaning. For words like pain, arguably the intentional content is just the qualitative content. But in what way does my rejection affect Block's argument? It means that, the theorem needs to be revised into the following: either there's no public meaning for words like "red" and everyone speaks differently, or there's "red" has a public, intentional content.

**The fallacy of *intentionalizing qualia***: experiential contents that can be expressed in public language are qualitative contents

**McGinn's argument for intentionalizing qualia**: "red" means the quality produced by red things; Either inverted spectrum is impossible (dismissed by Block), or people with inverted spectrum do not mean the same thing as our utterance of color.

**Block's' reply**: Given that we cannot know whether inverted spectrum obtains, then it's possible that everyone may have different color qualia. The consequence would be, everyone means something different when using color terms. This is not a good semantics of color.

**McGinn-Peacocke's reply**: The intentional content and the qualitative content are joined by our concepts; They sticks together. Therefore, spectrum inversion is inconceivable with ordinary color concepts.

**Block's reply**: My eleven-year old daughter can understand inverted spectrum easily. Therefore, spectrum inversion is perfectly using ordinary color concepts.

**Block's position**: 

- The intentional content of experience is functional
- The qualitative content of experience is not functional

> [!Warning]
> Of course formally there's nothing wrong with a stipulation where we want to characterize our mind with a functionalist account patched with a qualiatative account. But it seems it does not align with our understanding of "intending something". Block's account is incompatible with there being a "what it is like to intend something". Especially, according to Block, it seems zombies or Chinese rooms are capable of intending things.

**Concept of red**: Someone has a concept of red, in Harman's sense of concept, is to have the functional state of red

**Harman's setup**: There are only intentional content of experience; If the experience of color is inverted somehow, then they must have inverted intentional content

**Block's reply**: No one accept inverted spectrum having inverted intentional content; Inverted spectrum hypothesis says the qualitative content is inverted. Inverted intentional content is simply inconsistent with the functional account of concept, as the concept of red, according to functionalists, are just the concept that functions in a red way, not in a green way. So red concept can't function in a green way.

> I think Harman will reply that there's no such thing as qualitative content whatsoever. Maybe Harman is a zombie.
