## Three arguments against functionalism:

1. intrinsic nature of our own mental states is not captured by functionalist accounts because functionalist accounts are mere relations between inputs, internal states, and outputs.
2. A person blind from birth can know everything about physical and functional facts about color without having any experience of color.
3. Two people can have similar functional organization but experience inverted spectrum.

## Intentionality

**The properties of a represented object vs. The properties of the represention**: An intentional object doesn't need to be actual: When we intend a unicorn, we may have a *mental picture* of a unicorn. The mental picture is different from the unicorn being intended. The mental picture is mental, but the unicorn is not. 

### Two arguments from sense datum theorists:

**The argument from illusion**: 

1. Eloise sees some x that is brown and green in front of her
2. There is nothing brown and green in the exteral world
3. Therefore, Eloise sees some x that is internal and mental.

Line 4 is fallacious because the thing that is internal and mental is the representation, not the object. We should just say Eloise sees some x that does not exist. 

**Objection**: We are now choosing between two explanations: Eloise is intending something *mental*, or Eloise is intending something that *does not exist*. 

**Defense**: Harman says he don't know how to work out a theory of intentional object, but it is clear that when Ponce de Leon was looking for something, he was looking for something that is *not mental*. In other words, Harman is just saying "Eloise is looking for x" cannot derive that "x exists".

> Maybe this is the time when we need to ponder what exactly do we mean by "refer". According to Amie Thomson, we can introduce a semantic rule that says we can infer "x exists" from "Eloise is looking for x". If so, then x would refer? Or is it possible to say "x exists" without saying "x refers"?


**The argument from visual experience**:

1. Elois sees a tree that is presented from an angle or perspective
2. The angle or perspective is not an intrinsic property of the tree, but the intrinsic property of the experience of seeing the tree
3. Therefore, Elois sees the tree that is a mental (i.e. as a representation)

**Defense**: Deny 2: a painting is representational, and we can realize there are two different things and can tune our awareness to either the representation or the represented. But when we look at a tree, we cannot tune our awareness to the representation itself. Therefore, naively, the tree is not a representation. 

> [!warning]
> But I think the argument from visual experience is saying: It's not that we can't aware of the representation. We are aware of them, but we mistakenly attribute the features of the representation to the represented object. By reflection, we will realize the features, like how something looks like from a certain angle, are not intrinsic to the tree. Therefore, by reflection, we can distinguish between the representation and the represented. The alternative is to say we see the external object tree directly, but we also project some features to the tree.
> Harman seems to address this on p.42, but he used a wrong analogy: I may know a man, who happens to be a spy. In this case, I am not aware of the spy-ness. However, according to sense data theorists, we are aware of features of sense data. We just mistakenly ascribed these feature to the object.
> So both party agree on two things: there is a tree that we see from a certain angle, and there is a tree that is in the world. (p.38: objects of visual experience vs. objects in the world) And both party agree the object of our perception is the former. The only disagreement seems to be merely the following: should we call the former a representation of the latter? And they seems to talk past each other: Harman said we shouldn't because naively we don't take it as a representation; And sense datum theorists said we should because by reflection, this explains the difference between the object of visual experience and the object in the world. This is merely a verbal dispute?


**An additional comment on pain**: When we feel pain in the leg while it's actually caused by a spinal injury, the intentional object is located in the leg, but the experience itself is not. There are some sense in which the pain is hallucination, but we say the pain exists because the truth condition is "the experience of pain exists", not "the intentional object of the painful experience exists".

## Assessment of the First Objection

**The first objection**: functionalism cannot explain the intrinsic quality of experience

**Reply**: 
1. Normally, there is no awareness of the intrinsic quality of experience. Everything are quality of the represented object. Therefore, there's nothing to be explained.
2. Even if someone did some brain surgery so that they are aware of the intrinsic quality of experience, the functionalist account would be able to explain it just like how the functionalist account explains how we perceives trees and tables (except now the object being perceived is the brain process itself)

> [!warning]
> The dialectic here is the following: the antifunctionalist asks how functionalism can explain the sensation of redness when we are looking at an apple. And Harman is replying that if you are requiring me to explain the feature of experience, then there is no such thing; if you are requiring me to explain the feature of the represented object, it is explained by the apple itself because the redness is a feature of the object apple.
> However, there is a mistake here. Harman earlier distinguishes two things: the intentional object, and the object in the world. And we (normally) only have ontological commitment to the former, but not the latter. But some properties, like being the angle of view belongs to the intentional apple, not the actual apple. The anti-functionalists' challenge is how to explain the additional features, like disgusting, or looking red, which we do not think is a property that is "really out there on the object".
> (Additional comment on a property being "really on the object": if we think a property is really on the object, then we would judge the object changes if the object looses this property. For example, if I stand next to an apple, then the apple has the property of being next to me. If I move away, the apple no longer has this property, but we do not judge that the apple has changed. Therefore, the property "being next to me" is not "really on the apple")
> (This argument appeals to a primitive concept of change, however. If we have a different intuition about "change", things will be different.)
> In a shorter refutation, Harman is saying the features like being red is an intrinsic quality of the object; But our judgement of "really on the object" differs from this.

## Perception and Understanding

**The second objection**: A colorblind person can learn something new when they restore their color vision, even if they are completely knowledgeable about the functional description of colors.

**Functionalists' account of concepts**: A concept is defined in terms of: 1. its connection with the perceptual input; 2. its connection with other concepts; 3. its connection with the behavioral output.

**Harman's reply**: In order to know the red, they need the concept of red. But the blind person cannot have the concept of red. Therefore, they cannot know all the facts about red. But the objection says the blind person can know all the facts about red. So the objection is based on a mistaken premise.

> [!warning]
> 
> The argument is obviously flawed. I don't have to have the concept of red to know the truth of a proposition. For example, I don't have to know who exactly is Superman, though I know it is true that Superman can fly. Therefore, I don't need to be able to form the concept "red" to know that the sentence "red has such and such functional role" is true. Something more needs to be said.

## Inverted Spectrum

**The third objection**: Inverted spectrum cannot be explicated in functionalism term

**Harman's reply**: Belief content is the perceptual content. Given that Alice and Fred have inverted perceptual content, they have different belief. But they both say "it's red" when they see strawberries. Therefore, either (a) one of them is not correctly using language to express belief, or (b) 

> [!warning]
> 
> Then tension here is the sameness of belief report and the difference in belief content. 


> What do we mean when we say we have an experience of somthing? In ordinary language, when we say we have a good/bad experience, most of the time we are talking about some non-representational states like satisfaction, fear, anger, joy, etc. The "experience" of seeing a tree, however, is hardly something we say in ordinary language. 

> What exactly is the demand of "give an account" when we want to "give an account for intrinsic quality"? For example, we may say a circle is the graph of $x^2+y^2=r^2$ in Cartesian plane. But we may still ask why the set of points that fits this function has such circular geometrical feature. A mathematician would just say the question is confusing.
