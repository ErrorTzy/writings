Three arguments against functionalism:

1. intrinsic namture of our own mental states is not captured by functionalist accounts because functionalist accounts are mere relations between inputs, internal states, and outputs.
2. A person blind from birth can know everything about physical and functional facts about color without having any experience of color.
3. Two people can have similar functional organization but experience inverted spectrum.
