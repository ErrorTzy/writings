## Three arguments against functionalism:

1. intrinsic nature of our own mental states is not captured by functionalist accounts because functionalist accounts are mere relations between inputs, internal states, and outputs.
2. A person blind from birth can know everything about physical and functional facts about color without having any experience of color.
3. Two people can have similar functional organization but experience inverted spectrum.

## Intentionality

**The properties of a represented object vs. The properties of the represention**: An intentional object doesn't need to be actual: When we intend a unicorn, we may have a *mental picture* of a unicorn. The mental picture is different from the unicorn being intended. The mental picture is mental, but the unicorn is not. 

### Two arguments from sense datum theorists:

**The argument from illusion**: 

1. Eloise sees some x that is brown and green in front of her
2. There is nothing brown and green in the exteral world
3. Therefore, Eloise sees some x that is internal and mental.

Line 4 is fallacious because the thing that is internal and mental is the representation, not the object. We should just say Eloise sees some x that does not exist. 

**Objection**: We are now choosing between two explanations: Eloise is intending something *mental*, or Eloise is intending something that *does not exist*. 

**Defense**: Harman says he don't know how to work out a theory of intentional object, but it is clear that when Ponce de Leon was looking for something, he was looking for something that is *not mental*. In other words, Harman is just saying "Eloise is looking for x" cannot derive that "x exists".

> Maybe this is the time when we need to ponder what exactly do we mean by "refer". According to Amie Thomson, we can introduce a semantic rule that says we can infer "x exists" from "Eloise is looking for x". If so, then x would refer? Or is it possible to say "x exists" without saying "x refers"?


**The argument from visual experience**:

1. Elois sees a tree that is presented from an angle or perspective
2. The angle or perspective is not an intrinsic property of the tree, but the intrinsic property of the experience of seeing the tree
3. Therefore, Elois sees the tree that is a mental (i.e. as a representation)

**Defense**: Deny 2: a painting is representational, and we can realize there are two different things and can tune our awareness to either the representation or the represented. But when we look at a tree, we cannot tune our awareness to the representation itself. Therefore, naively, the tree is not a representation. 

> But I think the argument from visual experience is saying: It's not that we can't aware of the representation. We are aware of them, but we mistakenly attribute the features of the representation to the represented object. By reflection, we will realize the features, like how something looks like from a certain angle, are not intrinsic to the tree. Therefore, by reflection, we can distinguish between the representation and the represented. The alternative is to say we see the external object tree directly, but we also project some features to the tree.
> So both party agree on two things: there is a tree that we see from a certain angle, and there is a tree that is in the world. (p.38: objects of visual experience vs. objects in the world) And both party agree the object of our perception is the former. The only disagreement seems to be merely the following: should we call the former a representation of the latter? And they seems to talk past each other: Harman said we shouldn't because naively we don't take it as a representation; And sense datum theorists said we should because by reflection, this explains the difference between the object of visual experience and the object in the world. This is merely a verbal dispute?


**An additional comment on pain**: When we feel pain in the leg while it's actually caused by a spinal injury, the intentional object is located in the leg, but the experience itself is not. There are some sense in which the pain is hallucination, but we say the pain exists because the truth condition is "the experience of pain exists", not "the intentional object of the painful experience exists".

## Assessment of the First Objection

**The first objection**: functionalism cannot explain the intrinsic quality of experience

**Reply**: 
1. Normally, there is no awareness of the intrinsic quality of experience. Everything are quality of the represented object. Therefore, there's nothing to be explained.
2. Even if someone did some brain surgery so that they are aware of the intrinsic quality of experience, the functionalist account would be able to explain it just like how the functionalist account explains how we perceives trees and tables (except now the object being perceived is the brain process itself)

> I think harman made a mistake here. The dialectic is the following: the antifunctionalist asks how functionalism can explain the sensation of redness, and Harman is replying that it is explained by the apple itself because the redness is a feature of the object apple.
> However, there is a mistake here. Harman earlier distinguishes two things: the object of experience, and the object in the world. And we (normally) only have ontological commitment to the latter, but not the former. Properties like the angle of view, or being disgusting or beautiful, are intrinsic to the former, not the latter. The problem is, if functionalism only adopts an ontology that accepts the object in the world, how can they explain the feature of the object of experience, like being disgusting?

> What do we mean when we say we have an experience of somthing? In ordinary language, when we say we have a good/bad experience, most of the time we are talking about some non-representational states like satisfaction, fear, anger, joy, etc. The "experience" of seeing a tree, however, is hardly something we say in ordinary language. 

> What exactly is the demand of "give an account" when we want to "give an account for intrinsic quality"? For example, we may say a circle is the graph of $x^2+y^2=r^2$ in Cartesian plane. But we may still ask why the set of points that fits this function has such circular geometrical feature. A mathematician would just say the question is confusing.
