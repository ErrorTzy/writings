Three arguments against functionalism:

1. intrinsic nature of our own mental states is not captured by functionalist accounts because functionalist accounts are mere relations between inputs, internal states, and outputs.
2. A person blind from birth can know everything about physical and functional facts about color without having any experience of color.
3. Two people can have similar functional organization but experience inverted spectrum.

Intentionality

**The properties of a represented object vs. The properties of the represention**: An intentional object doesn't need to be actual: When we intend a unicorn, we may have a *mental picture* of a unicorn. The mental picture is different from the unicorn being intended. The mental picture is mental, but the unicorn is not. 

Two arguments from sense datum theorists:

**The argument from illusion**: 

1. Eloise sees some x that is brown and green in front of her
2. There is nothing brown and green in the exteral world
3. Therefore, Eloise sees some x that is internal and mental.

Line 4 is fallacious because the thing that is internal and mental is the representation, not the object. We should just say Eloise sees some x that does not exist. 

**Objection**: We are now choosing between two explanations: Eloise is intending something *mental*, or Eloise is intending something that *does not exist*. 

**Defense**: Harman says he don't know how to work out a theory of intentional object, but it is clear that when Ponce de Leon was looking for something, he was looking for something that is not mental. In other words, Harman is just saying "Eloise is looking for x" cannot derive that "x exists".

> Maybe this is the time when we need to ponder what exactly do we mean by "refer". According to Amie Thomson, we can introduce a semantic rule that says we can infer "x exists" from "Eloise is looking for x". If so, then x would refer. 


**The argument from visual experience**:

1. Elois sees a tree that is presented from an angle or perspective
2. The angle or perspective is not an intrinsic property of the tree
3. Therefore, Elois sees the tree that is a mental (i.e. as a representation)

**Defense**: a painting is representational, and we can realize there are two different things and can tune our awareness to either the representation or the represented. But when we look at a tree, we cannot tune our awareness to the representation. Therefore, the tree is not a representation.
