Three arguments against functionalism:

1. intrinsic nature of our own mental states is not captured by functionalist accounts because functionalist accounts are mere relations between inputs, internal states, and outputs.
2. A person blind from birth can know everything about physical and functional facts about color without having any experience of color.
3. Two people can have similar functional organization but experience inverted spectrum.

Intentionality

**The properties of a represented object vs. The properties of the represention**: An intentional object doesn't need to be actual: When we intend a unicorn, we may have a *mental picture* of a unicorn. The mental picture is different from the unicorn being intended. The mental picture is mental, but the unicorn is not.
