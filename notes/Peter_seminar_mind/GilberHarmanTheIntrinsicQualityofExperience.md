## Three arguments against functionalism:

1. intrinsic nature of our own mental states is not captured by functionalist accounts because functionalist accounts are mere relations between inputs, internal states, and outputs.
2. A person blind from birth can know everything about physical and functional facts about color without having any experience of color.
3. Two people can have similar functional organization but experience inverted spectrum.

## Intentionality

**The properties of a represented object vs. The properties of the represention**: An intentional object doesn't need to be actual: When we intend a unicorn, we may have a *mental picture* of a unicorn. The mental picture is different from the unicorn being intended. The mental picture is mental, but the unicorn is not. 

### Two arguments from sense datum theorists:

**The argument from illusion**: 

1. Eloise sees some x that is brown and green in front of her
2. There is nothing brown and green in the exteral world
3. Therefore, Eloise sees some x that is internal and mental.

Line 4 is fallacious because the thing that is internal and mental is the representation, not the object. We should just say Eloise sees some x that does not exist. 

**Objection**: We are now choosing between two explanations: Eloise is intending something *mental*, or Eloise is intending something that *does not exist*. 

**Defense**: Harman says he don't know how to work out a theory of intentional object, but it is clear that when Ponce de Leon was looking for something, he was looking for something that is *not mental*. In other words, Harman is just saying "Eloise is looking for x" cannot derive that "x exists".

> Maybe this is the time when we need to ponder what exactly do we mean by "refer". According to Amie Thomson, we can introduce a semantic rule that says we can infer "x exists" from "Eloise is looking for x". If so, then x would refer? Or is it possible to say "x exists" without saying "x refers"?


**The argument from visual experience**:

1. Elois sees a tree that is presented from an angle or perspective
2. The angle or perspective is not an intrinsic property of the tree, but the intrinsic property of the experience of seeing the tree
3. Therefore, Elois sees the tree that is a mental (i.e. as a representation)

**Defense**: Deny 2: a painting is representational, and we can realize there are two different things and can tune our awareness to either the representation or the represented. But when we look at a tree, we cannot tune our awareness to the representation. Therefore, the tree is not a representation. 

> The argument relies on the assertion that, we cannot tune our awareness to the mental picture of a tree, like how we tune our awareness to the painting itself. Though Harman is not saying we cannot direct our attention to the experience at all. He is agreeing that we can (1) aware of the experience itself, and (2) aware of the experience having certain content. But we cannot aware of the sense data or representation itsself ("those intrinsic features of the experience by virtue of which it has that content")
> But I think the argument from visual experience is saying: it's not that we can't aware of the representation. We are aware of them, but we mistakenly attribute the features of the representation to the represented object. By reflection, we will realize the features, like how something looks like from a certain angle, are not intrinsic to the tree. 




**An additional comment on pain**: When we feel pain in the leg while it's actually caused by a spinal injury, the intentional object is located in the leg, but the experience itself is not. There are some sense in which the pain is hallucination, but we say the pain exists because the truth condition is "the experience of pain exists", not "the intentional object of the painful experience exists".

## Assessment of the First Objection

**The first objection**: functionalism cannot explain the intrinsic quality of experience

**Reply**: 
1. Normally, there is no awareness of the intrinsic quality of experience. Therefore, there's nothing to be explained.
2. Even if someone did some brain surgery so that they are aware of the intrinsic quality of experience, the functionalist account would be able to explain it just like how the functionalist account explains how we perceives trees and tables (except now the object being perceived is the brain process itself)

> What do we mean when we say we have an experience of somthing? In ordinary language, when we say we have a good/bad experience, most of the time we are talking about some non-representational states like satisfaction, fear, anger, joy, etc. The "experience" of seeing a tree, however, is hardly something we say in ordinary language. 

> What exactly is the demand of "give an account" when we want to "give an account for intrinsic quality"? For example, we may say a circle is the graph of $x^2+y^2=r^2$ in Cartesian plane. But we may still ask why the set of points that fits this function has such circular geometrical feature. A mathematician would just say the question is confusing.
