> Why do we think it is possible for us to hallucinate at all? It's not MISREPRESENTATION, it's NOT PRESENTATION: when we say we are hallucinating, what we are seeing is completely not anything. It's not like seeing a mirage or a fake barn: we misjudged the object, but we are still seeing something. Probably, the only scenario where we actually hallucinate is when we are dreaming. So some mechanism of our ordinary ontological commitment is revealed in our judgment of hallucination: we are seeing something, but we are ontologically committed to it.

## 1 Our ordinary conception of perceptual experience

### 1.1 Starting Points

1. **The Objects Question**: what is the nature of the direct *objects* of perceptual experience?
2. **The Structure Question**: in what sense are experiences directly *of* their objects?

### 1.2 Ordinary Objects

**Ordinary Objects**
: perceptual experience are directly of ordinary mind-independent objects.

**Transparency**
: Introspection reveals the mind-independent objects of experience.
: Introspection does not reveal anything else.

**Transparency** adds another constraint to **Ordinary Objects**, but it might be suspicious, because it seems when we are short-sighted and have a blurry vision, the blur is not present in the object, but we do experience it.

### 1.3 Presentation

An attempted answer to the Structure Question:

**Presentation**
: perceptual experience are direct *perceptual presentations* of their objects.

### 1.4 Direct Realism

**Direct Realist Presentation**
: perceptual experience are *direct perceptual presentations of ordinary objects*.

 **Direct Realism**
: We can directly perceive ordinary objects.

### 1.5 The character of experience

- **The Character Question**: what determines the phenomenal character of experience?

**Direct Realist Character**
: The phenomenal character of experience is determined, at least partly, by *the direct presentation of ordinary objects*

### 1.6 The common kind claim

- **The common kind Question**: are veridical, illusary, and hallucinatory experiences fundamentally the same, do they form a common kind?

**Definitions**:

- A **veridical experience** is an experience in which an ordinary object is perceived, and where the object appears as it is.
- An **illusory experience** is an experience in which an ordinary object is perceived, and where the object appears other than it is.
- A **hallucination** is an experience which seems to the subject exactly like a veridical perception of an ordinary object but where there is no such perceived or presented object.


**The common kind claim**
: veridical, illusory, and hallucinatory experiences form a common kind

## 2 The Problem of Perception

**The Problem of Perception**
: If illusion and hallucination are possible, then (direct) perception is not possible.

**Central argument**:

A.  In an illusary/hallucinatory experience, a subject os not directly presented with an ordinary object.
B.  The same account of experience must apply to veridical experience as applies to illusory/hallucinatory experiences.

Therefore,

C.  Subjects are never directly presented with ordinary objects

But C contradicts with **Direct Realist Presentation**,
