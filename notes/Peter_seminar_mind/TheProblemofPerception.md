> Why do we think it is possible for us to hallucinate at all? It's not MISREPRESENTATION, it's NOT PRESENTATION: when we say we are hallucinating, what we are seeing is completely not anything. It's not like seeing a mirage or a fake barn: we misjudged the object, but we are still seeing something. Probably, the only scenario where we actually hallucinate is when we are dreaming. So some mechanism of our ordinary ontological commitment is revealed in our judgment of hallucination: we are seeing something, but we are ontologically committed to it.
