**The oddity of morality**

Ordinary people talk about morality without much trouble. From a young age, we grow up in environments where our parents teach us what we should or shouldn't do. If we fail to follow these rules, we are often punished, learning painful lessons along the way. This process is commonly known as "socialization." Most of us go through it successfully. As a result, we internalize these norms, adjusting our psychology to see them as natural. This is how we, as children, come to learn what we *ought to* do.

However, this somewhat nihilistic view of morality does not rule out the possibility of a justified basis for moral obligations. The way we learn something does not necessarily reflect its true nature. For instance, we begin learning math by counting on our fingers, but the foundations of mathematics have nothing to do with fingers. Instead, math is grounded in complex axiomatic systems.

But if there is a justified basis for morality, what could it be? Consider evil creatures like cats. Cats are often think of as by nature indifferent and self-serving. But they can be trained to use a litter box instead of relieving themselves anywhere. However, we tend to believe that our understanding of "we ought to do something" is fundamentally different from how a cat might understand "I ought to poop in that box." We assume there is something unique about human psychology—something beyond the psychological mechanisms of animals like cats.

But this assumption may be misleading. We don’t really know what goes on in a cat’s mind. When we claim that human morality is something above and beyond cat psychology, we might be projecting fantasies onto the cat's mental processes. For instance, we may think that cats associate painful punishment with pooping outside the litter box. We explain their behavior as purely driven by a desire to avoid that punishment. If the cat were to forget the punishment, we assume it would have no reason to continue using the litter box.

But this does not seem entirely right. In the human world, we often observe that people act purely out of habit. For example, someone might instinctively check their phone first thing in the morning—not because they are expecting an urgent notification or have a specific reason, but simply because the action has become routine. This does not seem unique to human, since forming a habit does not require intelligence. It is more similar to establishing conditional reflex. Therefore, even if cats forget the pain of punishment, they might still use the litter box out of habit, without needing to consciously associate the behavior with avoiding punishment.

However, even if this account of habit applies to cats, we still believe that human morality has something more to it. Our morality seems more stable and reflective than mere habits. Consider a trained cat, for instance. A professional trainer might teach the cat to use a litter box at a pet shop. Later, the cat is sold to a new owner. If the cat is intelligent enough, it might eventually reflect on its behavior. It could realize that the trainer, who imposed painful consequences for pooping outside the litter box, is no longer present. Motivated by its natural desires, the cat might then abandon the habit and begin pooping wherever it pleases.

Human morality, on the other hand, appears more enduring. To avoid a crude comparison, let us turn to Kant's example, lying. Perhaps, as children, we were punished for lying and developed a habit of telling the truth. However, even if we grow up and believe that no one will punish us for lying, Kant argues that we still ought to tell the truth. This is because the categorical imperative binds us to act morally, regardless of external consequences.

**Kant's solution**

Let us assume we accept the claim in the second section of the Groundwork: if there is a *law of action* with absolute necessity, it would be Kant's categorical imperative. However, this raises a striking question: why should we call this law of action a *moral law*? Why not simply call it Kant’s law of some kind of intellectual game?

In the third section of the _Groundwork_, Kant argues that the categorical imperative binds us because it is grounded in the concept of free will. He claims that if we do not presuppose free will, we cannot conceive of ourselves as capable of action. But since we clearly do act, we must assume that our wills are free. According to Kant, since freedom means not being determined by natural causation, it must give itself law. And law means necessity. Therefore, if we have free will, we are bound to follow the categorical imperative. In short, Kant's justification for morality rests on the following conditionals: if we act, then we are free; if we are free, then we are bonded by categorical imperative.

There may be multiple potential problems with this argument. But the most striking one is related to freedom. In *Source of Normativity*, Korsgaard outlines three conditions that any satisfactory answer to the normative question must meet (pp. 16-18):

1. It must address someone who actually faces the demand of morality from a first-person perspective and asks why they should comply
2. It must meet the "transparency" condition. The answer must still work even when the agent fully understands the explanation of morality's origins and mechanisms
3. It must appeal deeply to our sense of who we are, since morality can demand sacrifices that could be as bad as death

Kant's argument does not seem to satisfy Korsgaard's first condition. To illustrate, let us consider a person named Smith. Kant's reasoning is that if Smith believes he is acting, he must presuppose that he is free. And if Smith believes he is free, he must then be bound by the categorical imperative. However, this chain of reasoning involves a significant leap. Just because Smith believes _P_ (that he is acting), and _P_ presupposes _Q_ (freedom), it does not follow that Smith believes _Q_.

One might argue that if Smith is rational, he would, upon reflection, come to believe _Q_. But even this does not address the issue of _binding beliefs_. If a belief like _Q_ is to be binding in the sense Kant requires, Smith must grasp _Q_ through direct acquaintance, not merely through a rational inference.

Let's look at an example to clarify what I mean. Returning to the somewhat nihilistic account mentioned earlier, we, as children, learned the concept of "ought to," in a way akin to how a cat learns. In this way of learning the concept, "ought to" is closely tied to a mental state that directly motivates us to act (or not act) in certain ways. In other words, this "nihilistic ought to" comes from direct experience, like the memory of punishment and reward. 

However, the categorical imperative does not work in this way. The categorical imperative seems to be something that can only be understood through rational deduction alone. It is similar to how we comprehend abstract mathematical ideas, like infinity. We can rigorously define infinity using concepts like $\epsilon - \delta$, but we never experience infinity directly.

One easy way to address this worry is just to say that it does not necessarily bind everyone. If you do not accept it, then I will just classify you as an immoralist. This seems, in some sense, to be Timmermann's view. He seems not worried because he said there' are not a lot of immoralists after all, and *most of us* will still find it binding out of some inexplicable reason. I think Timmermann's analysis has poked to the core question that I want to discuss later in this paper, but he is too optimistic about Kant. I guess his wishful thinking that most of us will find it binding stems from the fact that he’s spent way too much time with Kant and Kantians such that he lost grasp of the real world. But if a moral theory does not bind us, we should try to find a better theory. 

Kant himself seems to pose something like "respect for humanity," or "dignity" in order to address this problem. But how could it not just collapse into a mere inclination or desire? Of course we can define a moral feeling that is not an inclination but still give us a sense of bindingness. But what is this thing, exactly? Without further explanation, this just is completely ad hoc.

**Korsgaard's solution**

While introducing some modifications, Korsgaard largely follows Kant’s framework. She reinterprets Kant’s idea of the “presupposition of freedom” in terms of what she calls the authority of reflection. According to Korsgaard, as self-conscious beings, we are aware of our own mental activities. For example, imagine being in a restaurant, deciding what to order. You cannot simply say, “I’m a determinist; I’ll just wait and see what happens,” and then do nothing. Reflection forces you to engage with your reasons and decide what to do next.

In this process of reflection, you must appeal to principles to guide your reasoning. Korsgaard argues that these principles cannot come from outside but must instead come from reason itself. And since reason must follow its own laws, it must legislate some universal law, i.e. categorical imperative.

Up to this point, Korsgaard’s account mostly aligns with Kant’s. However, there is a potential issue with her argument, which I will discuss later. For now, let us assume that this account is sound. Now it leaves us with the question raised earlier: why should we take the categorical imperative to be a _moral law_? Korsgaard is aware of this problem explicitly and addresses it immediately.

According to Korsgaard, reflection compels us to adopt a conception of ourselves to guide our choices. For instance, if someone identifies as a mother, she will see herself as having an obligation to care for her children. In this sense, obligations arise from our commitment to certain roles and relationships. However, these roles are contingent and tied to hypothetical imperatives—they depend on specific circumstances or goals.

Despite this contingency, Korsgaard argues that we always aim at _some_ conception of a practical identity to give our actions coherence and meaning. Importantly, the drive to seek such a conception does not depend on any particular identity, like being a mother, a teacher, or a friend. Instead, it arises from our identity as human beings. This fundamental identity reflects Kant's idea of humanity as an end in itself. As a result, our reflective consciousness binds us to morality through this moral identity.

There are some problem with this account. Korsgaard is basically saying that since we operate under hypothetical imperatives, we must also presuppose the categorical imperative. But why does the presence of hypothetical imperatives require this presupposition? Korsgaard’s reasoning seems to be that hypothetical imperatives demonstrate our commitment to finding some law to guide our actions. However, this commitment, she claims, cannot arise from any specific practical identity. Therefore, it must come from the moral identity. Thus we are bound by categorical imperative.

But why are we committed to finding some law at all? Suppose I were a “shmagent” who doesn’t feel bound by consistent principles. As a shmagent, I might sometimes reflect and adopt a law-like principle, but at other times simply follow my inclinations without concern for coherence. Describing a shmagent is tricky, though, because any description might imply rules or patterns of behavior, even if they are not truly binding. To borrow Rawls’ distinction, such “rules” would be summary rules, not practical ones—they would simply reflect patterns in behavior rather than guiding principles.

Korsgaard might respond that our reflective nature compels us to adopt a unified conception of ourselves. To maintain this unity, we must act consistently, and consistency requires commitment to some law. However, a skeptic could counter this by appealing to Parfit’s view of personal identity. According to Parfit, personal identity is not a deep, intrinsic fact but depends only on psychological continuity. If this is true, then there’s no strong reason to assume that my future or past self is truly “me” in a meaningful sense. Without this deeper connection, there’s no necessity to remain consistent over time.

But Korsgaard might respond by arguing that even if Parfit is correct and there is no metaphysical ground for personal identity, there remains a practical basis for it. First, because we must act, we inevitably need to eliminate conflicts between our desires. Resolving these conflicts requires adopting a deliberative standpoint, one in which we coordinate and prioritize our desires. In this deliberation, our choices define who we are—they establish our practical identity—rather than leaving our identity to be shaped passively by external events or mere inclinations. Moreover, Korsgaard adds that our actions have a unity over time. Most actions only make sense when we see ourselves as cooperating with both our past and future selves. Without this unity, our actions would lack coherence. Thus, consistency is necessary if we are to make sense of ourselves as agents at all.

However, skeptics could still push back against Korsgaard’s argument. They might claim that her notion of personal identity on a practical basis, while rejecting a metaphysical one, is puzzling. First, what does it even mean to say we lack a deep, metaphysical personal identity on one perspective but have one on another perspective? Second, a skeptic might argue that they could simply choose not to reconcile their conflicting desires and instead follow their instinct. Skeptics would then reject the idea that we need to “make sense” of our actions in a unified way. They can just rely on psychological instincts rather than consistent principles. Even when they reflect or deliberate, from this perspective, it might simply be another product of these instincts rather than a commitment to unity. While it may happen that one often acts consistently, this doesn’t mean one is _committed_ to consistency or that such commitment is essential for agency.

**Structural problem for Korsgaard and Kant**

What is the structural problem for Korsgaard and Kant that lead to these problems? Notice that, both Korsgaard and Kant gives an argument that is similar to "Since we do something, we must presuppose something." But as I have argued before, something cannot bind us by using logic alone. The criticism to Kant's presupposition also applies to Korsgaard's. The result of this kind of fallacy leads to shmagency problem. A skeptic can just say, I am not an agent who presupposes humanity or freedom. I am just a shmagent who do not like to presuppose things. Then I do not need to commit to the fancy concepts like humanity or freedom.

The core problem with this type of argument is its foundation in practical reasoning: it suggests that acting would psychologically presupposes some X, which in turn is linked to some form of law. Yet, this method of justification is flawed when viewed from both a third-person and first-person perspective. From the first-person view, again, we don't inherently accept Q simply because P implies Q. From a third-person standpoint, this isn't a metaphysical proof. We can't rationally affirm the existence of X. Once we think about this belief, we'll find it lacks proper foundation. This is because only beliefs formed through a truth-directed process, i.e. theoretical reasoning, can withstand reflection. You will lose the belief formed by practical reasoning alone under scrutiny.

**Velleman's reduction**

If a proper account cannot rest on practical reason, we may turn to theoretical reason. Velleman offers us a ground of normativity that is grounded on theoretical reasoning. He argued from the fundamental human drive for self-intelligibility. Velleman sees humans as inherently driven to understand the world around them. This isn't just a passive reception of information; it's an active process of making sense of things, looking for patterns, and forming coherent explanations. Velleman presupposes this as our "intellectual drive." Also, similar to Korsgaard, Velleman also appeals to reflection and self-awareness. We reflect ourselves as objects in the world that can be understood. The combination of theoretical reasoning and self-awareness creates a drive for self-intelligibility. We want our actions, thoughts, and feelings to make sense to us.

I will go no further from the self-intelligibility to practical reasoning and conscience. I do believe Velleman's is taking the right approach, in the sense that we must start from some basic motive and emotion instead of rational argument in order to explain the bindingness of morality. But both Velleman and Korsgaard and setting moral agency on an important concept: reflection. According to Velleman and Korsgaard, since we are self-conscious creature, we reflect when we act. And morality are grounded on our reflection. 

But Reflection does not seem to show-up all the time. Take the example of breathing: we do not consciously reflect on whether we should inhale or exhale, nor do we deliberate about commanding our bodies to perform these actions. Does my self-conception as a rational agent include breathing? Hardly. In fact, I believe our reflective rationality rarely engages in most aspects of ordinary life. Consider this question: when was the last time you consciously made a moral choice? The answer may not come easily, as such moments of active reflection are infrequent.

This lead Velleman to use the awkward phrase "full-blooded action." Maybe Velleman will contest that, what I am saying has nothing to do with morality. I am talking merely about behavior, but not action. Breathing has nothing to do with will. Therefore, it do not need to be connected with normativity.

But what is a will, really? Will seems to be something between intention and action. 

This raises an issue: if our reflective rationality is sporadic rather than constant, when does it emerge? And more importantly, how can we be bound by its moral force when it is absent? Can we control when should we reflect?

One possible response is that we do not need to pinpoint exactly _when_ reflection occurs. Reflection, whenever it arises, evaluates past actions and judges whether they were moral or not. While we may not feel the binding force of morality in the moment of action, we often feel afterward that we _should_ have acted differently. According to this view, moral force is not present during the action itself but emerges retroactively through reflection.

This explanation may have a point. However, it at least seems incomplete. The phenomenology of our everyday experience seems to suggest otherwise. Even when we are not actively reflecting or reasoning about our actions, we still seem to feel the force of morality. Our sense of obligation or moral pull often operates beneath the surface, guiding us even without deliberate reflection. Thus, while reflection may enhance our awareness of moral force, it cannot be the sole source of it.



There seem to be three possibilities to explain this:

1. Reflection appears randomly, without a clear trigger.
2. It is summoned by specific animal inclinations, such as desires or instincts.
3. It operates in the background continuously, but we fail to notice it most of the time.



The random show-up view does not make a lot of sense. What does random mean, anyway? One plausible understanding is that it may be caused by some inexplicable psychological process that is hard to understand. For example, we may find that 

Let's look at the summon view. Sometimes we think fast, sometimes we think slow. This claim is not only plausible phenomenologically, but also in terms of evolutionary biology. We are doing a lot of things in the same time, and it is impractical to add a pondering process before we do anything.  For example, when we want to reach a switch and turn off the light, we need to turn our head around to find the switch, stand up from chair, move our legs, stretch our arm, press the switch, etc. Do we need to ponder whether I am doing a moral action before conducting each of these? Ordinary people would concede that we don't need to. 

The problem here is that, from the first person perspective, one cannot really tell whether it is an evil scientist injecting thought to you, or there is an disorder in your sense of agency.




Another problem is the derivation of obligation from practical identity.

What is this bindingness, anyway? A standard answer is something close to desire but more stable than it. But let's just set this stability constraint aside. W
I think philosophers always underestimate how weird can human psychology can turn out to be.

**Emergency example**
There are many cases where moral choices must be made in an extremely short period of time. For example, you are a pilot and your plane is crushing. There are three people on your plane but an there is only two parachute. You must distribute the parachute in 10 seconds, or the height of the plane will not be enough for parachuting and everyone will die. And assume there is no previously established protocol on how to deal with this situation, and you must decide on you own because you are the pilot. In this case, you are not really allowed to use your agency and ponder about your choice.

It has become a standard argument against naturalism in both philosophy of mind and metaethics. The argument goes like this: If we try to reduce some normative property into non-normative ones, it will no longer retain the normative power in the first person perspective.
