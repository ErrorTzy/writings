# Rawls

Written after Theory of Justice, kinda "rethinking"

> Is Rawls still intuitivism? In P. 520, he said "latent in common sense"

The notion of person

Rational party from original position
Where exactly is this concept coming from?
 
> Rawls' (moral) person seeming only arise when the society is between absolute abundance and absolute scarcity; In the extreme cases, justice would not arise.
> Kant clearly think that there is a metaphysical fact about reason

Two principle of justice:

1. The principle of equal liberty
2. Equal opportunity (to social resources) and difference principle

Concept of good:
In the Theory of justice: you cannot do perfection if you dont have such two principle.

> what if we are thinking ourselves as parties?

Rational Autonomy: Kant's hypothetical imperative
(Full) Autonomy: Kantian autonomy

Methodology: 

Original position, used to select real society
How to select? Veil of ignorance

We pick out the first principle because it assures that anyone will pursue the good

We pick out the second principle because it helps us to pursue their own good

Questions:

1. How Rawls' theory is considered constructivism? What he is constructivism? Why this is Kantian constructivism?
2. Content vs. Normativity
(Is it focused on the content itself, or it is giving an account of how it has normative power)

Not just maximize our own interest


Basic structure of a society is the institution, which is criticized by some feminists

View each other as moral persons

Why do we still need "veil of ignorance" while we already have rationality? For rationalizing.

Pure procedural justice vs. Perfect procedural justice
- Example of pure procedural justice: "I cut you choose"

Two layers:

1. Should be justifiable for rational agent
2. Every agent should know and recognize

--> Should be simple and easy to understand

> The publicity part could be term paper
> The "you know that I know" is not in Kant
> For Kantian's citizens, they do not need to recognize these things. Kant's law can apply to a kingdom of demons

## Lecture I

The concept of freedom and equality & how they are represented

The concept of freedom: two aspects:
1. freedom of persons:
    a. Representation: no fixed goodness
2. freedom of independence: own concept of good:
    a. Representation: xxx
    serving one's own end vs. finding the condition of doing
3. (A third aspect?) Take our responsibility of our end

The concept of equality:
1. Everyone is represented


What is the difference between Kant and Rawls

Kant: personal maxim, metaphysical
Rawls: social, need publicity

> How different, exactly?

Rawls: The procedure is fixed, but the outcome does not have to be fixed. I proposed these because I am really smart and I think this is the outcome of the procedure.


# O'Neill

Chap. 11: critique of Rawls: Smuggling some idea into his theory; May be reduced to relativism

Two strategy when  Rawls is pressed:
- Realism
- Relativism

Notion of the person:
The veil of ignorance is to model the *reasonable power* of the notion of person.
But where does the reasonable power coming from?
Charge of relativism: If it is just from Rawls' own concept of person, then this will lead to relativism.
Charge of idealism: (?)

Response: This is the fundamental nature of human being (formulation of humanity, very Kantian, metaphysical --> Kant is happy with this solution)

The veil of ignorance want to strip away race, gender, etc. But it does not strip away the reasonable power. This is already deciding what is relevant to morality. What is the justification of this decision?

Why am I committed to the project of universalization?
