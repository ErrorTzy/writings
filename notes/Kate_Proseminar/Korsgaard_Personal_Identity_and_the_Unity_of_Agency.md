# Personal Identity and the Unity of Agency Handout

## Intro

Two views on a person

- **Utilitarians**: passive; experience as fundamental; input accepting
- **Kantians**: active; agency as fundamental; output producing

Example: On "what should be done for them"

- **Utilitarians**: People are claimants standing to each other. Therefore burden for one can be compensated by another. 
	- `How does this follow?`
- **Kantians**(Rawls): Utilitarians wrong! The general case is that we make agreement and act together!
- **Utilitarians**(Hume): Kantians wrong! I can reduce this to a feeling of acting together!
- **Kantians**(Korsgaard): From a moral point of view, utilitarians wrong! You cannot reduce me into experience! I will reduce you into agency instead!


## Parfit's Theory of Personal Identity

### What is personal identity?

**Physical Continuity**: continuity of human body


- **Parfit**: Physical Continuity view wrong!
	- Not sufficient: A changed so radically to be the same person
	- Not necessary: A swaps body to B, no continuity between A-body person and B-body person


**Psychological Continuity**: continuity of psychology

1. **Non-reduction view**: Cartesian ego/subject is a non-reducible entity
2. **Reduction view**: Nothing over and above a series of *R-related* physical and mental events


- **Parfit**: Non-reductionists wrong! 
	- `No argument?`


### Parfit's definition


**Definition**: A and B are the same person iff. A and B are continued and unique.


- **Parfit**: Personal identity does not matter.
	- There is no case where you would care about identity as long as you have psychological continuity (i.e. you survived).


### Consequence on morality


- **Parfit**: Some responsibilities[^1] are not grounded by metaphysical facts.
	1)  Some responsibilities are only grounded by some special relationship.
	2)  R-relation is not this kind of special relationship.
	3)  R-relation is the most special relationship you can get. 
	4)  Therefore, some responsibilities are not grounded by metaphysical facts.


## The Unity of Agency


Even if there is no metaphysical ground, there can be some practical ground.

### Unity at a given moment

Two needs of pragmatic unity
 
 - **Eliminating conflict**: In the split split-brain scenario, your body cannot both do and not do something at the same time. 
- **Deliberation standpoint**: If we deliberate and choose, then we are doing it in the coordinator position. The fact that there is a coordinator shows the unity of agency. 
	- `Why is this a pragmatic argument? This seems vey factual.`




- **Korsgaard**: This practical ground is better than Parfit's metaphysical ground.
	- Metaphysical ground need to explain where the normative power comes from.
	- It is clear that we have the need of pragmatic unity.


### Unity over time

- **Need of Plans and Long Term Relationship**: To do anything takes time. We have needs to achieve some ends that requires planning the future and maintaining relationship. In order to carrying out plans, you have to assume you are one continuous person.
	- `This seems less factual and sounds like wishful thinking. There can be someone who is always planning and changes the plan at the next moment. The normativity of the abolished plan is unclear.`


### What kind of things bear unity? 

- **State**: a single agent that resolves conflict, deliberates, interact with other nations and carry out plans
- **Human body**: Given the current technology, our body is the atomic unit of action. But really, whatever that has meets the criteria counts as a single agent.

## The Unity of Consciousness

Consciousness is unified, since it is always continuous and can directly access the consciousness in the past. What makes the unity?

- **Cartesian view**: 
	- **The unity comes from**: a persisting psychological subject.
- **Parfit**: Cartesians wrong! Consider the split-brain case. 
	- **The unity comes from**: experiences being co-conscious or be the object of a single state of awareness. There is nothing over and above a unified experience itself.
	- `I'm not sure about the argument why split-brain case refutes Cartesian view` 
- **Korsgaard**: Parfit not quite right! 
	- **Something right from Parfit**: Consciousness is the feature of experiencing activities themselves. Nothing over and above.
	- **Something wrong from Parfit**: There is a distinction *being engaged in a conscious activity* and *being conscious of an activity*. For example, when an animal hunts, it engages in the former but not aware of it. Therefore it does not engage in the latter.
	- **The unity comes from**: one's ability to coordinate and integrate activities.
	- This explains why split-brain patients functions normally but have some anomaly: There is some weakening in the coordination and integration, but not completely

## Agency and Identity

Going back to Kant:
- Attitude from **theoretical reason**: Explanation and prediction
- Attitude from **practical reason**: Justification and choices

1)  Practical point of view is not a theoretical fact (Parfit)
2)  If we want to distinguish actions and choices from biological and psychological laws, then we have to adopt the practical point of view.
3)  If we adopt the practical point of view, then our action is authorial, i.e. your choice makes who you are, not what happens to you makes you who you are

## The Moral Differences

### Future Concern and Paternalism

**Utilitarians**(Parfit): Paternalism good!

1)  Great imprudence is seriously wrong.
2)  If we do not have obligation to prevent anyone from great imprudence (because it is their own business), then we do not have obligation to prevent ourselves from great imprudence. (because personal identity is merely a matter of degree, there is no clear border between self and others)
3)  We have obligation to prevent ourselves from great imprudence because it is seriously wrong
4)  Therefore, we have obligation to prevent anyone from great imprudence (Universal Paternalism)

**Kantians**(Korsgaard): Parfit wrong!

- We have the obligation to prevent ourselves from great imprudence because we assume we have a unified life. `What if I am not planning to make plans and maintain relationships in the first place?`
- We do not have obligation to interfere others unless I have the right to do it, not how wrong others are doing.
- Paternalism is only justified in a few cases (Restricted Paternalism)
- Something right about Parfit: we should not care just about ourselves because we are also a part of some other agencies, e.g. the state

### Compensation and Distributive Justice

- **Utilitarians**: We should burden one to benefit another so that the sum of utility increase.
- **Kantians**(Rawls): Utilitarians wrong! 
	- If a burden does not come with a compensation to the same person, then the burden is not justified.
	- The reason why utilitarians have this view is because they confuse social choice with individual choice.
- **Utilitarians**(Parfit): Rawls wrong!
	- We cannot tell if the compensation goes to the same person. 
	- Everyone agrees that parents can burden their child and the child grows up, becomes another person and get compensated.
- **Kantian**(Korsgaard): Parfit wrong! Rawls right!
	- Even if the compensation does not go to the same person, it goes to the same life.
	- Parfit is confusing "the same person" with "the same life". Even if personal identity is merely conventional, it does not undermines the unity of life.
	- We are not connected to any lives. We only share life within a restricted scope. `But we do have united nation and the deliberative institution`

## Conclusion

Two meanings of morally neutral:

1. not intended to be deployed in moral thinking
2. do not presuppose moral theory

**Korsgaard**:

- (1) does not make sense
- (2) is worth having, but Parfit does not have it:
	- Parfit presupposes that life is a series of experience. This is taking the theoretical point of view instead of the practical point of view.
	- But only from the practical point of view can moral concepts generated.
