## I. Introduction
My theory is obvious and uncontroversial.

## II. Demonstratives, Indexicals and Pure Indexicals

 I want to develop a semantical theory of the pronouns 'I', 'my', 'you'; the demonstratives 'this', 'that'; the adverbs 'actual', 'present', etc.
 
 I used to call them "demonstratives," but now I changed my mind and call them indexicals ==why?==

The definition of this group of words: 
- the referent is dependent on the context of use, and 
- the meaning of the word provides a rule; the rule applies to the context and determines the referent.

### True demonstratives vs. Pure indexicals

Definition of **true demonstratives**: 
- indexicals that is incomplete without an associated (usually visual) demonstration, like "that"
- Given the context and the linguistic rules, you still need a demonstration to determine the referent ==what is the definition of "context" here?==

Definition of **demonstratum**: what is demonstrated by demonstration

An incomplete demonstrative is not vacuous.
**incomplete demonstrative**: Using a demonstrative without giving a demonstration
**vacuous demonstration**: having no demonstratum (hallucination) or too many demonstratum (pointing to more than one things)

Definition of **pure indexicals**: 
- no associated demonstration is required, like 'I', 'now', etc.
- Given the context and the linguistic rules, the referent is determined

Some indexicals can have a true demonstrative use and a pure indexical use, like "here":
- I am in *here*
- In two weeks, I will be *here*

## III.Two Obvious Principles

**Principle 1**: The referent of a *pure indexical* depends on the context, and the referent of a *demonstrative* depends on the associated demonstration. ==demonstration AND context?==

**Principle 2**: Indexicals, pure and demonstrative alike, are directly referential.

## IV. Remarks on Rigid Designators

I used to call indexicals rigid designators, but this is not right.

### Rigidly designator vs. Directly referential Term

Two senses of rigid designators: 
1. Designate the same x in *every* possible world (Kaplan agree)
2. Designate the same x in the possible world *where x exist* (Kaplan does not agree)

Kripke's confusion: 
If the bearer of a name were not to exist, then the name would designate nothing
"Hitler does not exist" would have been true because what 'Hitler' would have designated would have not existed.
==What's wrong with this?==

Definition of **directly referential**: 
- an expression whose referent, once determined, is fixed in all possible circumstance, i.e. is taken as being the propositional component. ==like I say "now" now, the "now" here is fixed. No matter when I look at the this sentence, it will not affect the meaning of "now"?==
- The term fix and secures the referent independently before any circumstance of evaluation. Therefore it designates the object in all possible world even in world where the object does not exist. ==what does this even mean?==

### Context vs. Circumstance of evaluation

Definition of **context of use**: the occasion of use. In different occasions of use, a direct referential term may have different referent
Definition of **circumstance of evaluation**: also called *circumstance* or *counterfactual situations*; the context has been already given, the referent of a direct referential term has been fixed

A description can be rigid in all possible circumstances (like the n described by $(P \land n^{2} = 9) \lor (\neg P \land n + 1 = 4)$), but it is not directly referential because it is logically complex and does not directly provide an object.
The difference between a rigid designator and a direct referential term is their restriction on directness.

**Example:**
In the context of use, "I" refers to the agent of the context. ==context means the language user's state? Context is first-person and circumstance is third-person?== However, there is no agent in the evaluation circumstance.

### Descriptive sense vs. Propositional content

A proper name may have no sense; indexical may have a limited sense; a "dthat" has a full-blown sense - but none of the sense enters the propositional content

## V. Argument for Principle 2: Pure Indexicals

Consider the following sentences:

1. I wish I were not speaking now
2. All that is now beautiful is faded
3. It is possible that in Pakistan, in five years, only those who are actually here now are envied

In these sentences, "now", "here" clings to the context of use, not the circumstance of evaluation in the future or counterfactual situations. Therefore, the descriptive meaning is used to fix the referent in the context of use, but is not carried to the circumstance of evaluation.

Objection: "now" and "here" are just variables that refers to some relevant features of the context.

Response: what relevant feature? How does it refer? ==what kind of response is this? Why can't I say it's a description that explicitly seeks the context of use?==

## VI. Terminology Remarks

### (i) Content and Circumstance

First sense of meaning: content

Definition of (Carnap's) **Intension**: A function that takes *circumstance* as input and give *extension* as output
Definition of **Content**: "what is said", evaluated in *circumstances* and gives *extension*

Content is finer grained then intension. Therefore, the same intension can *represent* different content. For example, a *rigid description* and an *indexical* can have the same extension in all circumstances. Therefore, according to Kaplan's definition of intension, they have the same *intension* and *extension*. But they have different *content*.

*Intensional operators* operates on contents.

The *content of a sentence* is not a traditional proposition. Traditional proposition is eternal and does not change throughout time. The content of a sentence changes throughout time because it is neutral to time, space, etc. But one can add "now", "here", etc in order to make the content a traditional proposition.

If any term is directly referential or rigid designator, then it must presuppose haecceitism. See "How to Russell a Frege-Church" ==why??==

### (ii) Character

Second sense of meaning: character

Definition of **Character**: that which determines the *content* in varying contexts. For example, 'I' refers to the speaker or writer.
Character can be represented by a function that takes *context* as input and *content* as output.

f: context -> g
g: circumstance -> extension

Meaning and context determines intension
Intension and possible world determines extension

The function of **non-indexicals** is fixed and have nothing to do with the context; what the function of **indexicals** returns is *context-sensitive*
For example, for a description, it will always return the structure of some property. For 'I', it will return the person based on the language rule (character) when applied to the context

Therefore, intensional interchangeability can be understood as:
1. the character does not change after interchanging
2. the content does not change after interchanging

## XIV. Summary of Findings: Pure Indexicals

The character is linguistic rule used to fix the referent of an indexical, but it is *not a synonym* for the indexical. In order to be synonyms, they need to have the same content. The relationship between character and content resembles sense and reference, in the sense that character determines content.
