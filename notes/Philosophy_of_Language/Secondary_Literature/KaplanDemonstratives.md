## I. Introduction
My theory is obvious and uncontroversial.

## II. Demonstratives, Indexicals and Pure Indexicals

 I want to develop a semantical theory of the pronouns 'I', 'my', 'you'; the demonstratives 'this', 'that'; the adverbs 'actual', 'present', etc.
 
 I used to call them "demonstratives," but now I changed my mind and call them indexicals ==why?==

The definition of this group of words: 
- the referent is dependent on the context of use, and 
- the meaning of the word provides a rule; the rule applies to the context and determines the referent.

### True demonstratives vs. Pure indexicals

Definition of **true demonstratives**: 
- indexicals that is incomplete without an associated (usually visual) demonstration, like "that"
- Given the context and the linguistic rules, you still need a demonstration to determine the referent ==what is the definition of "context" here?==

Definition of **demonstratum**: what is demonstrated by demonstration

An incomplete demonstrative is not vacuous.
**incomplete demonstrative**: Using a demonstrative without giving a demonstration
**vacuous demonstration**: having no demonstratum (hallucination) or too many demonstratum (pointing to more than one things)

Definition of **pure indexicals**: 
- no associated demonstration is required, like 'I', 'now', etc.
- Given the context and the linguistic rules, the referent is determined
