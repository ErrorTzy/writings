# Introduction

denoting phrase:

1. denoting but does not denote anything, i.e. the present King of France
2. denote one definite object, i.e. the present King of England
3. denoting ambiguously, i.e. a man

## knowledge about VS. acquaintance

the thing we only reach by means of denoting phrase

e.g. The center of mass of the solar system at a definite instant is some definite point

**acquaintance:**

sense: acquaintance with perceptions

thought: acquaintance with logical character `(?)`

all thinking start from acquaintance, but it succeeds in thinking about many things with which we have no acquaintance

# Russell's theory

**Construction:** taking variable as fundamental:

C(x), x is an undetermined variable, then:

- C(everything): "C(x) is always true"
- C(nothing): "'C(x) is false' is always true"
- C(something): It is false that `(`'C(x) is false' is always true`)`

> What does "always" mean, then? And is Russell avoiding the concept of negation, but used the concept "false"?

**Remark:**

- Here, "C(x) is always true" is ultimate and undefinable.
- The meaning of "everything", "something", "nothing" is assigned to every proposition they occur.

**Construction:**

I met a man: I met x and x is a human

- C(all men): "If x is human, then C(x) is true" is always true
- C(no men): "If x is human, then C(x) is false" is always true
- C(some men): It is false that "'C(x) and x is human' is always false"

The father of Charles was executed:

- It is not always false of x that "x begat Charles and that x was executed", and that
- "if y begat charles, y is identical with x" is always true.

Thus all denoting sentences are reduced

# Why this theory is better than Frege's and Meinong's

## Denotation of Words

### Meinong: any grammatically correct denoting phrase stands for an object.

**Disadvantage:** "the round square" would exsist, which violates the law of contradiction

### Frege: sense and reference

**Advantage:** avoid non-existent object

**Disadvantage:** We seems to denote "the King of England" when we say "the King of England is bald". However, when we way "the King of France", it is plainly false instead of being non-denoting.

> Russell seems to have an instinct that vacuous statment are plainly false, but do mean something. I do not share that instinct.

## Denotation of Propositions

Consider "If Ferdinand is not drowned, Ferdinand is my only son":

If "Ferdinand is not drowned" is false, then this sentence would be true. Then it matters whether sentence with non-exisitent

**Meinong**: allow non-existent at the cost of the law of non-contradiction

**Frege**: the dichotomy of sense and reference is too artificial, and the "null-denotation" is weird.

## Criteria: Solving puzzles

**(A)** a=a and a=b seems different even when a and b are the same thing, i.e. Scott is the author of Waverley

**(B)** By the law of the excluded middle, either "A is B", or "A is not B"; but what about "the present king of France is bald"

**(C)** Admitting that "if something is predicated, then it exists" sometimes breaks the law of contradiction.

**(D)** consider a phrase C (i.e. the first proposition in the set of proposition {A,B}.). C has both the meaning and denotation.

If we want to get the meaning of C, we cannot say "the meaning of C" because it would be the meaning of its denotation(the meaning of A), not the meaning of C itself. We need to say "the meaning of 'C'" in order to get C's meaning.

Similarly, if we way "the denotation of C", it can be understood as the denotation of C's denotation (that is, A's denotation). `We should say "the denotation of 'C'"`

There is no backwards road from denotation to meaning; we can only use another denoting symbol to denote a meaning (i.e. use "C" to denote C's meaning).

> Is he saying that, when C enters a proposition, it is automatically processed as its denotation, thus Frege's puzzle is still not resolved?

**Russell's theory**

preserves the law of contradiction, while explains the identity proposition better

> to some extent Russell is proposing a theory that separate sense and reference of "seemingly proper names". What about two proper names gather together?

**primary occurrence**:

the premise of the denoatation is independent:

i.e. Scott wonders the King of France is bald -> There is one man that is the king of France, and Scott wonders if this man is bald.

**secondary occurrence**

the premise of the denotation is a part of the meaning.

i.e. Scott wonders the King of France is bald -> Scott wonders if there is one man that is the King of France, and he also wonders if this man is bald.

# Consequence of Russell's theory

Whatever phrase we do not acquaint, we understand them from denoting phrase (i.e. Apollo, other minds). Therefore, we can talk about it without understanding it.

> How much can we doubt about this "acquaint"?
