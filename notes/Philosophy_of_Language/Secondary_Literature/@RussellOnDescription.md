description

definite: the xxx vs. indefinite/ambiguous: a xxx

# Indefinite Description: a so-and-so

Example: I met a man

**Remark**:

1. When I met Jones and I said *I met a man*, what I said is not *I met Jones* because there is no contradiction between I met a man and I did not meet Jones.
2. I met a man is natural and can be easily understood
3. No actual man (entity) enters this sentence because when *I met a man* is false (i.e. I lied), there is no reason to believe Jones should be supposed to enter the proposition than anyone else should.

> is proof 3 valid? why nothing enters?

**Construction**:

*I met a man* = the function "I met x and x is human" is sometimes true

> there exists some x that x is met by me and x is human

which is not the same as "I met *i*"

in other words, it is $\exists x(\psi x \cap \phi x)$ (it is sometimes true that $\psi x \cap \phi x$)

the point is, no constituent `constant?` is presented in such sentence

**Defence:**

There is no "unreal objects" like "the golden mountain" or "the round squre" because if no one thought about them, there will be nothing left of them.

ref: how can we talk about non-exisistence?

def: if we attibute significance to groups of symbols which have no significance, we then have illusions.

And we can see that "... is unreal" is meaningful only when "..." is a description

**Conclude:** *Socrates is an x* and *Socrates is x* are different. The former one is a description

# Definite Description: the so-and-so

**Remark:**

Names are different. *Socrates* is a simple symbol, and its parts (letters) are not meaningful symbols. *the teacher of Plato*, on the other hand, is comprised of symbols. However for the moment such distinguishment is not yet important.

**Remark:**

name: directly designating an individual, e.g. Scott

description: the "meaning" of description picks out the results, e.g. the author of Waverley

> this resembles Frege's sense-reference dichotomy. But Russell's theory does not touch the "reference" but only categorize languages.

**Proposition:**

Description cannot be replaced by name in a sentence even if they all designate the same object.

**Proof:**

Scott is Scott $\neq$ Scott is the author of Waverley

The previous one is a vacuous a priori truth, while the latter is informative.

**Defence:**

ref: *Scott is Sir Walter* -> description is replaced by name, but it is still informative and not a priori.

def: The sentence *Scott is Sir Walter* is the abbreviation of *The person named Scott is the person named Sir Walter*, in which the names are used as descriptions. If they are used as names, then it is as trivial as Scott is Scott.

> Basically it's Frege's idea of indirect discourse. And probably we do think the object "Scott" here is used as a description while the subject remains a name.
>
> Or what if we has false impression? What if a name does not designate anything? Then the name is also a description of, say, "the person that *I believe to be* Scott". But we indeed refer to that object, despite we used the wrong name. Maybe it becomes "private language".

**Remark:**

x=x is true for all names x, but it does not apply to descriptions, as the proposition shows. This is because a description presupposes the existence of the object select by the description.

e.g. *The King of France is the King of France* is false

**Construction:**

The only difference between indefinite and definite description is that definite description is unique `single not plural?`. Therefore, "the so-and-so" means "a so-and-so" + "there is no more than one so-and-so". For example, "the author of Waverley was Scotch" iff.

1. at least one person wrote Waverley
2. at most one person wrote Waverley
3. whoever wrote Waverley was Scotch

Formally, let $\phi$ be the property of so-and-so, and $\psi$ be the predicate, then the so-and-so is something can be expressed as "there is a term c that (1) $\phi x$ is always equivalent to 'x is c,' (2) $\psi c$ is true"


**Remark:**

Thus a name must name something. therefore if $\alpha$ is a name, then $\alpha$ exists is an a priori truth. For the expression "x exists" to be informative, x must be a description


**Application:**

Primary occurence: take the entire sentence and substitude the description for x

Secondary occurence: only take part of the proposition concerned and substitude the description for x

i.e. The king of France is not bald

-> (secondary) ***It is false that*** there is a c that x = c $\leftrightarrowâ†”$ x is the king of France, and x is bald

-> (primary) there is a c that x = c $\leftrightarrow$ x is the king of France, and x is ***not*** bald
