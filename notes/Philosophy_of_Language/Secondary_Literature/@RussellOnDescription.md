description

definite: the xxx vs. indefinite/ambiguous: a xxx

Indefinite: a so-and-so

Example: I met a man

Remark:

1. When I met Jones and I said *I met a man*, what I said is not *I met Jones* because there is no contradiction between I met a man and I did not meet Jones.
2. I met a man is natural and can be easily understood
3. No actual man (entity) enters this sentence because when *I met a man* is false (i.e. I lied), there is no reason to believe Jones should be supposed to enter the proposition than anyone else should.

> is proof 3 valid? why nothing enters?


Construction:

*I met a man* = the function "I met x and x is human" is sometimes true

> there exists some x that x is met by me and x is human

which is not the same as "I met *i*"


Remark: There is no "unreal objects" like "the golden mountain" or "the round squre"


I met a man =/= I met Jones

man here is not any actual man but a concept, thus a function: I met x and x is a man.
