Is equality the relationship between objects or between names or signs of objects?

1. Either equality is the relationship between objects, or is the relationship between names of objects.
2. if equality is the relation between names of objects, then there is no difference between a=b and a=a.
3. There is difference between a=b and a=a.
4. Therefore, equality is the relation between objects.

Explanation: when we say a=b, we are saying that the objects that the name "a" and "b" designate (bedeuten), while when we say a=a, we are saying that the names itself are the same.

# Words and expressions

the Bedeutung of a sign and the sense of a sign

Bedeutung vs. proper name: 
An object only have one proper name, but a Bedeutung can have infinite senses attach to it.

different expressions -- definite sense -- Bedeutung

Bedeutung vs. sense: 
Sense does not have to have Bedeutung. eg. "the least rapidly convergent series" has sense but not Bedeutung 
Normally we speak of words as their Bedeutung. But when we quote words or uses indirect speech, their (indirect) Bedeutung is their (customary) sense.

idea (Vorstellung):

Bedeutung is object itself; 
Idea is internal and subjective;
Sense lies in between: the object has been transferred into (subjective?) language system, but itself is still objective

vs. Bedeutung: my idea is an internal image of the Bedeutung.
vs. sense: the same sense will lead to different ideas
idea belongs to someone
(idea itself cannot Bedeutung, but Frege did not elaborate on this)

A proper name (word/sign/combination of signs/expression)  expresses its sense, stands for (bedeutet) or designates (bezeichnet) its Bedeutung.

How do you know there is a Bedeutung at all?
When we speak of a word, we do not intend to speak of the idea that particularly belongs to us, but the Bedeutung, which is presupposed by us.
e.g. "The Moon is bigger than the Earth"  is not "The Moon that I understand is bigger than the Earth that I understand"

# Sentence

"The Morning Star is a body illuminated by he Sun" is different from "The Even Star is a body illuminated by the Sun" has the same Bedeutung but different content of thought.
Therefore, thought is not a Bedeutung of a sentence.

Thought is the sense of a sentence, but we want to speak about its Bedeutung because we concern the truth value of a sentence. Then what is the Bedeutung of a sentence?


1. A sentence can only have sense but no Bedeutung when one does not care about its truth value.
Therefore, a sentence has its Bedeutung if and only if it has its truth value.

2. If a part of a sentence is replaced by another expression with the same Bedeutung, nothing remained unchanged except the truth value.

Therefore, The Bedeutung is the truth value itself.

> what about the fact or event?

Does truth value come from sense-Bedeutung, or subject-predicate?
"P is true" is the same as "P", and a subject-predicate can form only thought but not truth value, i.e. when an actor says "5 is a prime number"
subject and predicate are all elements of thought, but truth-value is not a part of the thought but the next level of thought.

knowledge = thought + truth value


judgement is the process of thought advancing towards truth value.


Since we speak of clauses as adjective clause, none clause, etc., sentences inside of a sentence is a word that takes the sense - Bedeutung model and the Bedeutung is the thought
