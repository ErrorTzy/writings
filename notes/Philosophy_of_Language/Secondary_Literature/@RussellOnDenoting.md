# Introduction

denoting phrase:

1. denoting but does not denote anything, i.e. the present King of France
2. denote one definite object, i.e. the present King of England
3. denoting ambiguously, i.e. a man

## knowledge about VS. acquaintance

the thing we only reach by means of denoting phrase

e.g. The center of mass of the solar system at a definite instant is some definite point

**acquaintance:**

sense: acquaintance with perceptions

thought: acquaintance with logical character `(?)`

all thinking start from aquaintance, but it succedds in thinking about many things with which we have no aquaintance

# Russell's theory

**Construction:** taking variable as fundamental:

C(x), x is an undetermined variable, then:

- C(everything): "C(x) is always true"
- C(nothing): "'C(x) is false' is always true"
- C(something): It is false that `(`'C(x) is false' is always true`)`

> What does "always" mean, then? And is Russell avoiding the concept of negation, but used the concept "false"?

**Remark:**

- Here, "C(x) is always true" is altimate and undefinable.
- The meaning of "everything", "something", "nothing" is assgined to every proposition they occur.

**Construction:**

I met a man: I met x and x is a human

- C(all men): "If x is human, then C(x) is true" is always true
- C(no men): "If x is human, then C(x) is false" is always true
- C(some men): It is false that "'C(x) and x is human' is always false"

The father of Charles was executed:

- It is not always false of x that "x begat Charles and that x was executed", and that
- "if y begat charles, y is identical with x" is always true.

Thus all denoting sentences are reduced

# Why this theory is better than Frege's and Meinong's

## Denotation of Words

### Meinong: any grammatically correct denoting phrase stands for an object.

**Disadvantage:** "the round square" would exsist, which violates the law of contradiction



### Frege: sense and reference

**Advantage:** avoid non-existent object

**Disadvantage:** We seems to denote "the King of England" when we say "the King of England is bald". However, when we way "the King of France", it is plainly false instead of being non-denoting.


> Russell seems to have an instinct that vacuous statment are plainly false, but do mean something. I do not share that instinct.


## Denotation of Propositions

Consider "If Ferdinand is not drowned, Ferdinand is my only son":

If "Ferdinand is not drowned" is false, then this sentence would be true. Then it matters whether sentence with non-exisitent .
