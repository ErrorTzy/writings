# Dualism and its problems

historical background:
The physical world seems to be well explained by Galileo and Newton

Plato and Aristotle: the dominance of form over matter

the mind vs. the "atom"

Descartes ad his Meditations on First Philosophy:

1. First Meditation: What can be called into doubt
2. Second Meditation: The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body
3. Third Meditation: The existence of God
4. Fourth Meditation: Truth and falsity
5. Fifth Meditation: The essence of material things, and the existence of God considered a second time
6. Sixth Meditation: The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body

core concept: "certaintyâ€œ. What is this?
"certainty" is a (subjective) state of mind, not an objective property
It is possible that the possibility of an event is 100%, but one still not certain about this event.

belief are sometimes mistaken -> examine belief -> a systematic method is needed

normal skepticism: sometimes we make illusions
extreme skepticism: evil demon, tricking us to believe that 1+1=3
Whatever can stay intact in the "evil demon" scenario can be a solid foundation that is free from doubt
