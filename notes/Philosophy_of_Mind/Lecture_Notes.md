# Dualism and its problems

historical background:
The physical world seems to be well explained by Galileo and Newton

Plato and Aristotle: the dominance of form over matter

the mind vs. the "atom"

Descartes ad his Meditations on First Philosophy:

1. First Meditation: What can be called into doubt
2. Second Meditation: The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body
3. Third Meditation: The existence of God
4. Fourth Meditation: Truth and falsity
5. Fifth Meditation: The essence of material things, and the existence of God considered a second time
6. Sixth Meditation: The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body

core concept: "certainty". What is this?
"certainty" is a state of mind, not a property of thing

## Second Meditation

### Arg 1: Universal Doubt

As long as the devil is deceiving me, I am not nothing
Therefore the *proposition* **"I think I exist"** is necessary true

Only when I am thinking about the devil, I can be certain that I exist. It is not that the inference structure that "I think, therefore I am"

#### Another version: Discourse on the Method

To assume the state of dream, what can be certain?
Inference structure: "I think, *therefore* I am"

The "devil" is (at least should) not a metaphysical existence, only a tool

### What am I: New method

**what come into my thought spontaneously and quite naturally** whenever I used to consider what I was

**Criticism:**

Why I am either a body or a soul or both? Can there be counterpart, or can there be alternative?

**The existence of body** cannot pass the methodology of doubt, while **the existence of mind** can

I am a thinking **thing** --> makes Descartes a substantial dualist

## Sixth Meditation

Cartesian Circle: I exist therefore god exists, god exists therefore I exist

### Arg 2: The conceivability argument

modern argument: philosophy zombies

I can clearly understand one thing apart from another, then the two things are distinct, *at least by God*.

The body of a man is a kind of machine made up from bones, nerves, etc and has movement without mind

**Reconstruction:**

I can conceive my mind and my body coming apart
Therefore, it is possible for my mind to be separated from my body
Thus, my mind and my body are different


**Criticism:**
basic structure: conceive -> concept -> metaphysical
Why would the activity of mind has metaphysical consequence?
Hesperus = Phosphorus?
the largest natural number is a concept but has no metaphysical existence


### Arg 3: Divisibility

the indivisibility of mind and the divisibility of body; underlying idea is still the conceivable argument

> why the mind is indivisible? 李麒麟：满足组合原则但不是整体/部分，前者是概念操作后者是空间操作


## Explanatory advantage of dualism

Descartes' argument
- I am my mind
- mind and body are different
- body is divisible and mind is not

other dualism:
- substance dualism
- property dualism
- predicate dualism: suspend metaphysical judgments, only distinct on language

What is "the mental stuff"? What is "thinking"? Is it a faculty? Is it a process? Can thinking -> mental substance?

Does physical object has to have extension?s

什么是“正确描述世界”？
不要被老师带偏，批判性阅读老师
```

## Pros and Cons 

- Pros:
    * The arguments are prima facie plausible
    * The crucial difference between mind and body
    * A framework for studying mind

- Cons:
    * The soundness/validity of the arguments are controversial (because the Cartesian account is only an intelletualist approach)
    * What is the nature of mind? The answer from dualists tend to compare, but not address them directly `why? isn't it just a un-reductable account?`
    * Counterarguments: How the interactions between mind and body?

# Behaviorism and Its Problems 

Gilbert Ryle (1900-1976): British ordinary language philosophy (the school that analyze language to understand phenomena)
Coined "ghost in the machine", best known book: *The concept of mind*

## Kyle's critique on Descartes

### Cartesian view on introspection:

A function of the mind, introspection/"mind eye", which is very different from normal sense because it is infallible

We cannot experience other minds. We can only understand other minds **by analogy**. 

### Categorical Mistake

The example of "university tour": 

- after seeing faculties and faculties, you ask: where is the university?
- after seeing battalions and squadrons, you ask: where is the march-past? 

This is a categorical mistake: the inability to use English language to wield concept

`李麒麟：Is the analogy valid? Descartes does not know how to use words?`

Wittgenstein's example: Expectation = minding the time, starting to anxious, etc

`李麒麟：And what is categorical mistake? Blackwell: putting things to different category as if they are categorically different. It presupposes a category. Is it circular? *A book on carogory mistake*`

`what? as if they are different?`

### Mental States are **Ryle:NOT** causes of behaviors

The properties that can describe physical things CANNOT be used for mental things. Therefore they are different. 
There needs to be a cause other than physical cause.

## Behaviorism: 

### Philosophy vs. Psychological

**Methodological Behaviorism**

Psychological approach only use words to **classify** behaviors. 
Psychology only treat mental states as the reasons to explain behaviors. They are not synonyms.
It is only a methodological preference to only investigate observable behaviors.
`It does not presupposes the metaphysical assumption that mental events are reductable to behaviors? It is only a tag that does not have to have intension?`

**Logical Behaviorism**

Mental talk only a convenient abbreviation of physical talk. They are synonyms. A stronger one is Ontological Behaviorism.
*This is only a language claim*. 

**Ontological Behaviorism**

Here does not exist mental entities. 
*This is a ontological claim*

`Think: Can the logical version derive the ontological version? It does not follow that the metaphysical entity must be physical`

### What is behavior?

1. Psychological responses: blood pressure, increase of heart rate, etc
2. Bodily movement: Walk, run, etc
3. Actions constitutes movement: i.e. The difference between monkeys accidentally writes an email vs. People writing email
4. Actions without movement: judge, assume, decide, calculate, etc. (mental act)

The last two types has **structure**. Behaviorists mainly concern the first two types because the last two contains non-observable components (the structure/intentionality`telos?`). Therefore, behaviorism is a *reductive physicalism*

`The definition of behavior is controversial`
