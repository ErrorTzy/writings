# Dualism and its problems

historical background:
The physical world seems to be well explained by Galileo and Newton

Plato and Aristotle: the dominance of form over matter

the mind vs. the "atom"

Descartes ad his Meditations on First Philosophy:

1. First Meditation: What can be called into doubt
2. Second Meditation: The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body
3. Third Meditation: The existence of God
4. Fourth Meditation: Truth and falsity
5. Fifth Meditation: The essence of material things, and the existence of God considered a second time
6. Sixth Meditation: The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body

core concept: "certaintyâ€œ. What is this?
"certainty" is a state of mind, not a property of thing
