# Dualism and its problems

historical background:
The physical world seems to be well explained by Galileo and Newton

Plato and Aristotle: the dominance of form over matter

the mind vs. the "atom"

Descartes ad his Meditations on First Philosophy:

1. First Meditation: What can be called into doubt
2. Second Meditation: The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body
3. Third Meditation: The existence of God
4. Fourth Meditation: Truth and falsity
5. Fifth Meditation: The essence of material things, and the existence of God considered a second time
6. Sixth Meditation: The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body

core concept: "certainty". What is this?
"certainty" is a state of mind, not a property of thing

## Second Meditation

### Universal Doubt

As long as the devil is deceiving me, I am not nothing
Therefore the *proposition* **"I think I exist"** is necessary true

Only when I am thinking about the devil, I can be certain that I exist. It is not that the inference structure that "I think, therefore I am"

#### Another version: Discourse on the Method

To assume the state of dream, what can be certain?
Inference structure: "I think, *therefore* I am"

The "devil" is (at least should) not a metaphysical existence, only a tool

### What am I: New method

**what come into my thought spontaneously and quite naturally** whenever I used to consider what I was

**Criticism:**

Why I am either a body or a soul or both? Can there be counterpart, or can there be alternative?

**The existence of body** cannot pass the methodology of doubt, while **the existence of mind** can

I am a thinking **thing** --> makes descartes a substantial dualist

## Sixth Meditation

Cartesian Circle: I exist therefore god exists, god exists therefore I exist

### Descartes' Argument 2: The conceivability argument

modern argument: philosophy zombies

I can clearly understand one thing apart from another, then the two things are distinct, *at least by God*.

The body of a man is a kind of machine made up from bones, nerves, etc and has movement without mind

**Reconstruction:**

I can conceive my mind and my body coming apart
Therefore, it is possible for my mind to be separated from my body
Thus, my mind and my body are different


**Criticism:**
basic structure: conceive -> concept -> metaphysical
Why would the activity of mind has metaphysical consequence?
Hesperus = Phosphorus?
the largest natural number is a concept but has no metaphysical existence


### Descartes' Argument 3

the indivisibility of mind and the divisibility of body; underlying idea is still the conceivable argument

> why the mind is indivisible? 李麒麟：满足组合原则但不是整体/部分，前者是概念操作后者是空间操作


## Explanatory advantage of dualism

Descartes' argument
- I am my mind
- mind and body are different
- body is divisible and mind is not

other dualism:
- substance dualism
- property dualism
- predicate dualism: suspend metaphysical judgement, only distinct on language

What is "the mental stuff"? What is "thinking"? Is it a faculty? Is it a process? Can thinking -> mental substance?

Does physical object has to have extension?s
