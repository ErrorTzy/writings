# Dualism and its problems

historical background:
The physical world seems to be well explained by Galileo and Newton

Plato and Aristotle: the dominance of form over matter

the mind vs. the "atom"

Descartes ad his Meditations on First Philosophy:

1. First Meditation: What can be called into doubt
2. Second Meditation: The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body
3. Third Meditation: The existence of God
4. Fourth Meditation: Truth and falsity
5. Fifth Meditation: The essence of material things, and the existence of God considered a second time
6. Sixth Meditation: The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body

core concept: "certainty". What is this?
"certainty" is a state of mind, not a property of thing

# Second Meditation

## Universal Doubt
As long as the devil is deceiving me, I am not nothing
Therefore the *proposition* "I am I exist" is necessary true

> Only when I am thinking about the devil, I can be certain that I exist. It is not that the inference structure that "I think, therefore I am"

### Another version: Discourse on the Method
To assume the state of dream, what can be certain?
Inference structure: "I think, therefore I am"

The "devil" is (at least should) not a metaphysical existence, only a tool

## What am I: New method
**what come into my thought spontaneously and quite naturally** whenever I used to consider what I was

> Why I am either a body or a soul or both? Can there be counterpart, or can there be alternative?

The existence of body cannot pass the methodology of doubt, while the existence of mind can
