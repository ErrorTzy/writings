# Scientific Background of Pseudonormal Vision

1. B-, G- and R-cones contains chemically different photopigments that response to wavelength at the given intensity level. 
2. Then some neural mechanism calculates the average signal (b,g,r)
3. Then the data is sent to rg channel (r - g) and yb channel (g + r - b)

If R-cones has the photopigments of G-cones, or G-cones has the photopigments of R-cones **but not both,** then rg channel will send a signal of 0 which leads to red-green-blind
If both, then the one will **not** have red-green-blind, but will have reversed feeling of red and green.

# Philosophical Consequence

## Challenge to Wittgensteinian

According to Wittgenstein, 'redness' only refers to the proper use of language game, not psychological vision. 

Therefore, Wittgensteinian cannot distinguish normal and pseudonormal people if they both can play the language game properly.

**Possible response:**

1. 'red' in daily sense is different from 'red' in the scientific sense.
2. The scientific result changes the language game

## Challenge to functionalism

### Conceptual functionalism

According to conceptual functionalism, when we say "x is red", we can refer x to two things: 

(1) the typical cause of "red state", and
(2) the influence of redness that act upon other states.

Now can conceptual functionalism distinguish normal and pseudonormal people?

For (1), the pseudonormal people have the same cause of color as normal people (because they learn it that way).
For (2), we still need empirical research to find out.

### Psychological functionalism

According to psychological functionalism, it is hypothesized that mental terms are the internal states with similar functions.

Can psychological functionalism distinguish pseudonormal rg channel states from the normal ones? We need to define the cone.

(1) The difference is the cone, but we cannot define the cone by its capability of sensing a certain color because according to color science, G-cones with r-photopigments are still called G-cones. `Can't I say the scientific term is wrong? G-cones with r-photopigments are not functionally G-cones.`
(2) The difference is their influence. But we want to ask why they have different influence. We cannot answer that 'they have different influence'.

The key issue for psychological functionalism is that color science hypothesized phenomenal concepts.
