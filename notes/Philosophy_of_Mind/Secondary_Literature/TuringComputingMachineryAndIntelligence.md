# Can machine think?

We need to define **machine** and **think**.


## Definition of Machine

Machine is restricted to digital computer (does not have to be electrical)

1. fixed rules
2. does not deviate from rules -- control
3. unlimited amount of storage (only finite storage is used at a time) -- storage
4. processor -- executive unit

--> variant: digital computer with a random element

Discrete state machine:

There are finite amount of internal state and input value; then given the internal state and input value, we know the output and the new internal state.

Digital computers can mimic any discrete state machine. Therefore it is called universal machine.


## New problem

### The gender game

A: man; Cause C to make the wrong identification
B: woman; Help C to make the right identification
C: interrogator; Determine which is man and which is woman

**Can machine think** -> **Can machine take the place of A without changing the accuracy of the interrogator's identification?**

This is not fair for machines because it is not symmetric. Man can never do calculations as fast as machines.
-- but if machines can success, then this objection won't be minded

It is assumed that the best strategy for a machine to win in this competition is to imitate a human.

## Negative Defense

1. **Theological objection**
2. **Wishful thinking objection**
3. **Mathematical objection**: Godel's theorem, Church-Turing thesis; Machine cannot perform some jobs:
    a. Respond: Human may also have limitation. Let's just try the test `This is not a satisfying response`
4. **The argument from consciousness**: Man not only behaves but also feels he is behaving:
    a. Respond: This will lead to solipsism because we only feels our own feelings.
    b. Also, qualia is a byproduct, not the essence of thinking
5. **Arguments from disabilities**: machines cannot be kind/beautiful/fall in love, etc.:
    a. Respond: This is only because you haven't seen one. As for machines cannot make mistakes, machine can make "errors of conclusion", but not "errors of functioning"
6. **Lady Lovelace's Objection**: Machines do whatever we know how to order it to perform:
    a. Respond: Machine learning is possible. We may not fully understand a complex machine, even if we may be able to understand it with a lot of time.
7. **Nervous system is not a discrete machine**:
    a. Respond: But at least it will give the right sort of answer
8. **The Argument from Informality of Behavior**: There is no set of rules that describe what a man should do in every conceivable set of circumstance:
    a. Respond: This confuses the laws of behavior with the laws of conduct
9. **The Argument from Extra-Sensory Perception**: Telepathy

## Positive Defense

Nuclear chain reaction analogy:

The mind of some are "sub-critical", which does not generates new ideas; The mind of some are "super-critical".
Now can machines be super-critical?

Skin of onion analogy:

Pealing off the skin; where is the onion? Human minds may also be mechanical, but we should not say there is no intelligence.

Therefore this is no reason to stop machines from thinking. It is only a problem of how to program.

How children learn:

1. The initial state
2. Education
3. experience

Education process:

Structure of the child machine = Hereditary material
Changes = Mutations
Natural selection = Judgment of the experimenter: punishment and reward

The process is based on scientific induction, thus not definite.

Imperatives:

To include things into well-established facts
