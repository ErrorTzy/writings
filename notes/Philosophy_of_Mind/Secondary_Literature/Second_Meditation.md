# The nature of human mind, and how it is better known than the body

methodology: find one thing that is certain and unshakeable, like Archimedes

Excluded from doubt: senses, memory -> body, shape, extension, movement and place

Even if some god put me into all these thoughts, there is still me.

## What am I?

### A rational animal

No. What is rationality and what is an animal?


### Body, the mechanical structure

definition of body: whatever has a determinatble shape and a definable location and can occupy a space in such a way as to exclude other body

No. If there is a malicious deceiver, then it is possible that I do not have a body


### Soul

the action of sense and perception: but since I have no body, I have no perception data

But thought is inseparable to me. Therefore, I am only a thing that thinks (having the ability to doubt, understand, affirm, deny, will, unwill, imagine and perceive )

> What if thought does not belong to me, but I am only randomly accessing thoughts that belongs to god? Then I only has the ability of understand, but not think.

> But that still says I have the power to understand all these things. Also how does mind "randomly access" thoughts is unclear


I cannot use imagination because imagining is to contemplate the shape or image of a corporeal thing

> But I can imagine 1+1=3. It seems to be a language issue.



### Identity arguement

I thinks myself

The 'I' that is being thought of is the same 'I' that thinks because the power of imagination and perception exists
