# Second Meditation

*The nature of human mind, and how it is better known than the body*

methodology: find one thing that is certain and unshakeable, like Archimedes

Excluded from doubt: senses, memory -> body, shape, extension, movement and place

Even if some god put me into all these thoughts, there is still me.

## What am I?

### A rational animal

No. What is rationality and what is an animal?

### Body, the mechanical structure

definition of body: whatever has a determinatble shape and a definable location and can occupy a space in such a way as to exclude other body

No. If there is a malicious deceiver, then it is possible that I do not have a body

### Soul

the action of sense and perception: but since I have no body, I have no perception data

But thought is inseparable to me. Therefore, I am only a thing that thinks (having the ability to doubt, understand, affirm, deny, will, unwill, imagine and perceive )

> What if thought does not belong to me, but I am only randomly accessing thoughts that belongs to god? Then I only has the ability of understand, but not think.
>
> But that still says I have the power to understand all these things. Also how does mind "randomly access" thoughts is unclear

I cannot use imagination because imagining is to contemplate the shape or image of a corporeal thing

> But I can imagine 1+1=3. It seems to be a language issue.

### Identity argument

I thinks myself

The 'I' that is being thought of is the same 'I' that thinks because the power of imagination and perception exists

## New methodology

give it completely free rein, and then tighten the reins

### Wax Argument

The sensory data of wax completely changed when it is melt, yet we still think the same wax remains

what the max remains is its extensibility and changeability. However, extensibility and changeability is not from my imagination because I cannot imagine infinite things, while extensibility and changeability are infinite.

distinctiveness does not come from my senses, but my judgement

Therefore it is once again clear that I exists because I judge.


# Sixth Meditation

*The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body

Material things can be preceived distinctly

Whatever can be preceived distinctly are the subject matter of pure mathematics

Subject matter of pure mathematics are capable of existing


Imagination also suggests that material things exists

imagination is the application of the cognitive faculty to a body


**imagination vs. understanding**

if I imagine a triangle, I will not only undertand it as a figure bounded by three lines, but also see the three lines with my mind's eyes. Yet if I imagine a chiliagon, I can understand that it consists 1000 sides but I cannot see the 1000 sides.


investigation on sensory perception

what I previously took to be preceived by senses and reckoned to be true and the reason for thinking this

reasons for calling doubts on this:

what should I now believe about them:
