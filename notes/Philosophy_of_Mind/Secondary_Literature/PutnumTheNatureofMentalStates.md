# "Are pains brain states?"



### Pain is Brain state

#### Negative Defense

##### Traditional rules for identity

When answering similar identity questions, analytical philosophy has two presuppositions:

1. being A = being B ↔ the meaning of A = the meaning of B
2. Being A is being B is informative only when it is reductive `i.e. A can be reduced to B`

<Techinical> Definition of terms:

- Property: predicates or functors
- Concept: The concept of x can identify x, but is not x

> Frege's distinction between sense and reference?

Two questions:

1. What counts as an answer when asking "what is the concept of x"?
2. What counts as an answer when asking "what is the property x"?

##### Property = Concept Fallacy

Refuting Carnap, Meaning and Necessity: property = concept

<Example>: Temperature is mean molecular kinetic energy, but the *concept* of temperature is not the *concept* of kinetic energy.

> What's Carnap's argument?

Now property ≠ concept, then we can refute that:

- Pain is not brain states, because I know I'm in pain, but I don't know what kind of brain state I am in.

This is not a valid argument because the concept of pain is different from the concept of brain-state does not prevent pain from being brain-state.

> Evaluation: Make sense to me

1. pain is not brain-state because identity must entail the same spacial-temporal region. But pain is in the arm while brain-state is in brain.

*REF*: Mirror image seems to locate behind mirror. Similarly, the Pain seems to locate in the arm but it can be actually in the brain

> It seems that Putnum is saying that, with some biological explanation, we can say that pain is in fact also in the brain.
> Evaluation: But is this possible at all? By what evidence can we say that 'pain is in fact in the brain' without accepting that pain is brain-state?

2. They are only correlated, but identity

It will be troublesome to explain how they are correlated and what is mental entity.

> Evaluation: This is only a methodological preference that, without *more reasons*, we should say two things are identical if they are correlated.
> But of course pain is subjective experience and brain-state is objective phenomenon. Then what counts as "more reasons"?
> Putnum's theory here is arguing that despite "subjective-objective" distinction, there still can be an identity.

The traditional way: if to say 'pain is brain-state' changes the meaning of 'pain', then 'pain is brain-state' is wrong

Putnum: this 'change of meaning' criterion is wrong. We should abandon the 'meaning' talk. 


#### Positive Defense


Technical notions: Probabilistic automation

Pain is probabilistic automation
pain is a factional state of the orgasm
pain cannot be divided (or there will be beehive)


Functional State vs. Brain State

Putnum: functional state
LB: Brain state

Putnum's version is compatible with dualism

What the brain-state theorist has to do?

A physical-chemical brain state that is both necessary and sufficient for pain

And we must not find pain with two different two brain state

The difficulty of behaviorism 

It does not have to have behaviors
If we cut nerves of two people, one is peripheral and one is pain, then they both cannot react.


> initial state + input state → individual inner state → output
> "function" is this abstract if-then structure; it only asserts the RELATIONSHIP between these endpoints, but do not assert anything about the metaphysical attributes of these endpoints
> A stronger version: not only computative function, but causal
>>> Why it's stronger? Why computative can be not causal?
> advantage: it is universal; different individual/species can be explained by the same structure (one function, different implements)
