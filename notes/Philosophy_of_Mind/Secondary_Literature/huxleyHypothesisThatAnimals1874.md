On the Hypothesis That Animals Are Automata, and Its History (Epiphenomenalism)

# Descartes' arguments

Animals are machine like sleeping human `because?`

We can observe this in ourselves so it is not outrageous.

Problem: Where are the evidences?

# Experiment outcome

Descartes' conclusion seems defensible according to experiments.

## Human example

It seems that only with the mechanisms can the body move.

## Frog example

A frog can do a lot of things with a head missing

If such unconscious act is possible, then it is possible `?` for animals to be automata.

# Huxley's arguments

Doctrine of continuity: why consciousness suddenly appears in human?

But animals are still automata. 

The causal relationship does not work (Epiphenomenalism)

Analogy of "fog from a train"

Leibniz
