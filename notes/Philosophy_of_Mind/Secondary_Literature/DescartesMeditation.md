# 1. Second Meditation

*The nature of human mind, and how it is better known than the body*

methodology: find one thing that is certain and unshakeable, like Archimedes

Excluded from doubt: senses, memory -> body, shape, extension, movement and place

Even if some god put me into all these thoughts, there is still me.

## 1.1. What am I?

### 1.1.1. A rational animal

No. What is rationality and what is an animal?

### 1.1.2. Body, the mechanical structure

definition of body: whatever has a determinable shape and a definable location and can occupy a space in such a way as to exclude other body

No. If there is a malicious deceiver, then it is possible that I do not have a body

### 1.1.3. Soul

the action of sense and perception: but since I have no body, I have no perception data

But thought is inseparable to me. Therefore, I am only a thing that thinks (having the ability to doubt, understand, affirm, deny, will, unwill, imagine and perceive )

> What if thought does not belong to me, but I am only randomly accessing thoughts that belongs to god? Then I only has the ability of understand, but not think.
>
> But that still says I have the power to understand all these things. Also how does mind "randomly access" thoughts is unclear

I cannot use imagination because imagining is to contemplate the shape or image of a corporeal thing

> But I can imagine 1+1=3. It seems to be a language issue.

### 1.1.4. Identity argument

I thinks myself

The 'I' that is being thought of is the same 'I' that thinks because the power of imagination and perception exists

## 1.2. New methodology

give it completely free rein, and then tighten the reins

### 1.2.1. Wax Argument

The sensory data of wax completely changed when it is melt, yet we still think the same wax remains

what the max remains is its extensibility and changeability. However, extensibility and changeability is not from my imagination because I cannot imagine infinite things, while extensibility and changeability are infinite.

distinctiveness does not come from my senses, but my judgement

Therefore it is once again clear that I exists because I judge.

# 2. Sixth Meditation

*The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body*

## 2.1. Argument from mathematics

1. Material things can be perceived distinctly
2. Whatever can be perceived distinctly are the subject matter of pure mathematics
3. Subject matter of pure mathematics are capable of existing

Therefore, Material things are capable of existing

## 2.2. Argument From imagination

imagination is the application of the cognitive faculty to a body, therefore it suggests that body exist

**imagination vs. understanding**

if I imagine a triangle, I will not only understand it as a figure bounded by three lines, but also see the three lines with my mind's eyes. Yet if I imagine a chiliagon, I can understand that it consists 1000 sides but I cannot see the 1000 sides.

## 2.3. Investigation on Sensory Perception

I perceive more distinctly by sensory perception than imagination. therefore I need to investigate senory perception.

### 2.3.1. What I previously took to be perceived by senses and reckoned to be true and the reason for thinking this

#### 2.3.1.1. Body and sensory data are not in me

I perceive:

- body
- sensation

These things comes without my consent and it is even more vivid than my meditation, it does not come from inside but from other things

#### 2.3.1.2. Somehow my body is attached to me

I believe my body is my body because:

- I could not separate from it
- I feel my appetites and emotions in this body
- I am aware of ticklings in parts of this body but not others.

However this seems to be how it is, taught by nature.

### 2.3.2. Reasons for calling doubts on this:

**Argument from Mistakes:** Sometimes the judges from external senses AND internal senses (feelings about amputated limbs) are mistaken

**Argument from Dream:** I also perceive in dream

#### 2.3.2.1. I am distinct from my body

What I can understand distinctly is capable of being created by God.

If I can distinctly understand one thing apart from another, then the two things are distinct

I can distinctly understand that I am a thinking thing and can exist without my body, thus I am distinct from my body.

#### 2.3.2.2. Sensory perception is not in me

> why? It has been discussed before in 2.3.1.1

I can exist without sensory perception and imagination, but they cannot exist without me.

The relationship between me and sensory perception and imagination is like the body itself and its color, shape, etc..

Since perception and imagination cannot be understood apart from corporeal things, it must be in corporealor extended substance. `?`

Since I do not have active perception but only passive one, perception is not in me.

#### 2.3.2.3. Corporeal thing exists

It is either in body, or creatures more noble than a body, like God.

Since I have the propensity to believe that they come from body, and God is not a deceiver, then there is body/corporeal things.

### 2.3.3. what should I now believe about them:

God ensures that what I am taught by nature contains some truth.

Nature taught me that:

- I have a body
- I am intermingled with my body
- Bodies possess differences
- My body can be affected by various beneficial or harmful bodies

Not from nature but from ill judgement:

- If my sense is not stimulated, then there is nothing
- Heat (a property) in a body is the same as the idea of heat (that property) in me


## 2.4. Meaning of nature

The meaning of "nature taught me that...": the knowledge regarding both mind and nature.

Nature does not teach me to have distinct and right judgment about external world, i.e. the size of the star is only the size of dust.
Nature only teaches me to distinguish the beneficial from the harmful

Problems: People may be tricked into eating poisonous but tasty food
Defense: People are drawn by sweetness, not by the poison
Problems: But the ill desire food or drink that afterwards turn out to be bad for them
Analysis: a malfunctioning clock still obeys the law of nature, just like a sick patient desire food or drink that are actually harmful
Problems for the analysis: the "nature" is not within a human body, but merely extraneous

> "the extraneous nature" is telos


Reply: Lets' consider the interior nature `where mind conflicts the body`, and why God does not prevent us:

Mind is single and complete; Body is divisible. Therefore, they are different

Different events may trigger the same sensation

The best devicable system is that the sensation helps the preservation of a healthy man `what is this line of reasoning for?`

Therefore, man are bond to be misled


Although man can be misled, but with sense, memory and intellect, we can judge without error.
