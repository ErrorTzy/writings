# What is logical behaviorism

What are minds, ideas, sensation in the physical world?

**Problem:** 
physical process itself is senseless. The mind and the physical process are correlated but not one.

A third possibility: logical behaviorism
mental events are logical constructions out of behavior events

Example:
numbers in modern logic: numbers are treated as logical constructions out of sets

Advantage of this methodology
advantage of this approach: get rid of unwanted entity like numbers but do justice to the appropriate body of discourse

**Problem:**
We know how numbers are constructed by sets, but we never know how mental events are to be logical construction out of behavioral events

The extreme version of logical behaviorism does not hold, but the weaker version is accepted by many: mind statements **in some way** entails behavior statements; the former one cannot be translated into the latter one but only because **the mind statement is more ambiguous**.


# Why logical behaviorism is wrong

## The Truism of behaviorism:

- We learn the intension of the word 'red' by looking at something red and comparing it with some feeling.
- We **CANNOT** learn the intension of the word 'pain' by looking at other's pain and compare it with one's own feeling. 

Therefore, the intension of the word 'pain' is not one's own feeling. `The implication is that, the intension of the word 'pain' is the phenomena, that are behaviors`

## Pain is not a cluster of phenomena, but their cause

'pain' is a cluster concept; there are many ways to say what a pain is. `?why it is a cluster concept?`; but is it not a cluster of phenomena because:

### Example of disease names

#### Polio

It is possible that all the polio symptoms are present but the virus is absent. 

#### Multiple Sclerosis 

Similarly, if we found a virus is normally the cause of multiple sclerosis, the hypothesis of the virus being the cause of multiple sclerosis will not be falsified by that in some exceptional cases 
  - the virus does not produce these symptoms, or 
  - these symptoms are not produced by the virus

### Explanation for disease names

#### Lexical Account

'multiple sclerosis' does not mean 'the simultaneous presence of such and such symptoms', but 'the disease *normally* responsible for the simultaneous presence of such and such symptoms'

#### Philosophical account

'multiple sclerosis' used to mean 'the simultaneous presence of such and such symptoms', then the meaning of 'multiple sclerosis' changed.

#### The problem of the philosophical account

Two counterintuitive cases:

1. Assume a doctor said 'I believe multiple sclerosis is caused by a virus' is at to, and the discover of virus being the origin of multiple sclerosis is at to. Then the doctor would be wrong because by at to 'multiple sclerosis' still includes the cases where virus is not the cause. `Is the doctor saying that "all the element in a set has the property of such and such?"`
2. Assume all the symptoms belongs to a set X by definition. Now if a doctor sees all the symptoms in X and says 'I believe this is not a case of polio', it would be self-contradictory. `A reply: Here, the symptoms are the *sense*, and 'multiple sclerosis' symptom is the reference. And the doctor is in fact speaking of its reference rather than its sense, just like saying 'I believe Aristotle is not the teacher of Alexander'`

> why can't I say the subject in a believe statement is different?
> The reason we believe the meaning of 'multiple sclerosis' changed is that we have 'an ideology of taxonomy'. There is not necessity of accepting that the virus IS the cause of multiple sclerosis (or, the definition of multiple sclerosis is what the virus causes in the normal situation) if the multiple sclerosis can be a combination of other factors. We can still keep the multiple sclerosis as the cluster of symptoms without taking the virus as a part of definition. Therefore, it is not counterintuitive to say the doctor is wrong, because even if the virus is discovered, some cases of sclerosis are still not caused by this virus.

The lexical account is more flexible and does not require any 'change of meaning' statements and is what laypeople and doctors would use as definition. Therefore, the lexical account prevails.

## The confusion between logical construction and causal relationship

Now given that the disease is "*normally* the symptoms of such and such":

In this case, there is some analytical entailment between 'multiple sclerosis' and 'the thing that normally being the symptoms of such and such', but the former one is not translatable to the latter one **not because 'multiple sclerosis' is systematically ambiguous while the symptoms are specific**. It is because **causes** are not logical constructions of their **effects**.  Similarly, mental events are not logical constructions out of behaviors

> ==Why? Why this explanation is correct and the systematical ambiguity explanation is wrong?==

Traditional dualists (`parallelists?`) would even question if there is such causal relationship. Just like in some possible world the virus may cause different symptoms, pain in some possible world can also NOT lead to the standard behavioral definition. Thus it is not identity.

> The logical behaviorists: Identity
> Putnam: causal relationship
> Traditionalists: There's even no causal relationship
> Putnam: It is indeed possible (in a possible world) that it does not cause behaviors. Therefore it must not be identity. 

> If A and B are logically equivalent, then there is no possible world where A is true and B is false, or vice versa. The truth of one necessarily entails the truth of the other. ==But is it possible for Aristotle and the author of metaphysics different? If so, why can this argument be valid?==

### Defense from logical behaviorism:

Identical not causal because sincere act entails mind events; Therefore they are identical

**Refutation:** 

Cannot define sincerity with pure behavior; They are not identical. It is only a matter of definition (that the definition is subjective) that makes one know his mind events. After knowing the event, one can have sincere behavior, or not. The process of knowing pain and behave are two detached process without being identical. 

> What does it have to do with definition? ==I don't understand this argument==

## Thought experiments

### Super-Spartans

People who endure pain out of ideological reasons but still speak of it.

**Doubt:** 

What about immature members in this society? They should still have unconditioned pain responses.

**Attack on Doubt:**
- What does unconditioned response mean? Does the *avoidance of pain* also count as unconditioned response? If the avoidance of response is a response, then we cannot tell what response it avoided from the behavior alone.
- A further thought experiment

### Super-Super-Spartans

The evolved Super-Spartans who born with the ability to avoid pain reaction. But they can still have pain because if they are removed from the ideology, they would be able to evince pain again.

The reverse way (causation of pain): The creature which feel pain when a magnetic field is present

**Doubt:**

What about verbal reports as their behaviors?

### Super-Super-Super-Spartans

The Super-Spartans who even starts to suppress the talk of pain/don't have pain in their language.

If this is correct, then there is no necessary entailment. The entailment is only contingent in our world.

**Doubt:**

Could this thought experiment be a self-contradiction?


### The doubt on the thought experiment

The thought experiment is intelligible, but not all intelligible thought experiments are valid. 

#### Doubled length thought experiment

Consider out of a sudden all distances are doubled, then we wouldn't notice it because we are also doubled in size.

This example is self-contradictory because the concept of 'length' is a relative concept to some standard. If the standard itself is also doubled, then 'everything's length is doubled' is self self-contradictory.

But it is not necessarily self-contradictory because length can be absolute. Even if so, if is false that we will not notice anything because the velocity of light/g/... etc. did not also double. 

Therefore is only superficially coherent but contains a deep absurdity.
