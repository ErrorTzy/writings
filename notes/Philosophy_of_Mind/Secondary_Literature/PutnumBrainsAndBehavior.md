# What is logical behaviorism

What are minds, ideas, sensation in the physical world?

Problem: physical process itself is senseless. The mind and the physical process are correlated but not one.

A third possibility: logical behaviorism
mental events are logical constructions out of behavior events

Example:
numbers in modern logic: numbers are treated as logical constructions out of sets

Advantage of this methodology
advantage of this approach: get rid of unwanted entity like numbers but do justice to the appropriate body of discourse

Problem:
We know how numbers are constructed by sets, but we never know how mental events are to be logical construction out of behavioral events

The extreme version of logical behaviorism does not hold, but the weaker version is accepted by many: mind statements **in some way** entails behavior statements; the former one cannot be translated into the latter one but only because the mind statement is more ambiguous.


# Why logical behaviorism is wrong

we can point out a standard red thing, but one cannot point to a standard pain (except pointing to behavior)
