Do not read the preface first. It is a clarification of the three lectures

Naming: philosophy of language
Necessity: metaphysics, modality

Naming:
- proper names vs. definite descriptions
- referring vs. denoting

Necessity:
- modality and its metaphysical problems

Kripke: Disagree with **proper names** as descriptions.

Russel: Proper names are synonyms of descriptions
Searle: Proper names have the same extension of descriptions (weaker)
Kripke: Both are wrong

The value of this work: connect two very important questions
