Do not read the preface first. It is a clarification of the three lectures

Naming: philosophy of language
Necessity: metaphysics, modality

Naming:
- proper names vs. definite descriptions
- referring vs. denoting

Necessity:
- modality and its metaphysical problems

Kripke: Disagree with **proper names** as descriptions.

Russel: Proper names are synonyms of descriptions
Searle: Proper names have the same extension of descriptions (weaker)
Kripke: Both are wrong

The value of this work: connect two very important questions

Lecture I

It is false that there are unicorns.
But it is possible that there are unicorns?

Kripke: false. We do not know **what circumstance there would have been unicorns**
*Unicorn* is not descriptions because it is designated by how it is initially designated. 

Referential use, description as proper name: "The man drinking Martini" even if no one is really drinking Martini
Attributive use, description as description: "The king of France"

Direct Referential Theory vs. Descriptivism of proper names

DRT: 
- Mill's view: names have denotation but not connotation
- Dartmouth: Dartmouth is still Dartmouth even if it is no longer at the mouth of Dart `continuum? identity problem?`
- The Holy Roman Empire is not holy; The United Nations is not a nation

Problem:
- If a name gets us the object in the first place, then how could one say "Aristotle does not exist"?

Descriptivism:
- Proper names are disguised descriptions. Or **how do you refer by proper names**?
- Searle's version, cluster theory:
    - solve the problem that "Plato is not the author of the Republic" would be self-contradictory if the sense of "Plato" is "the author of the Republic"
    - Taken as a theory of meaning:
        - proper name *is* cluster concept
    - Taken as a theory of reference:
        - weaker; Only saying that proper names *have the same extension* as cluster concept
        - But no adequate account for the difference for a=a and a=b `why?`

Problem:
- Proper names are simple. Descriptions are complex.

Necessity vs. contingency: metaphysical modality `?`
A priori vs. a posteriori: epistemology; can be known apart from experience
Certainty: psychology; can be doubt or not
