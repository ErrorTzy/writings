# Mind-Brain Identity theory

## Mind-Brain Correlation

It is true that empirically, there are a lot of correlations between mind an brain.

**Examples**

1. Injury to the brain -> impact on recollection, reasoning, perception and personality
2. Chemical changes in our brains (i.e. alcohol, drug) can affect our emotions, judgments, etc.
3. Senses are only remote/indirect causes, because we can block them by anesthesia.

> The examples shows that physical changes can cause mental changes. But it does not grantee that *all mental changes are caused by physical change*. It is possible that some mental changes happen without any physical changes.

> Assumptions: 
>
> Mental change cannot occur without physical change.
> Physical change cannot occur without mental change.
> That is, mental change is both necessary and sufficient for physical change.
>
> Also, Kim mentioned that it is taken as 'law-like', not accidental (What is the significance of this?)

**Mind-Brain correlation thesis**: For each type of mental event *M* that occurs to an organism *o*, there exists a brain state of *B* (*M*'s neural correlate) such that *M* occurs to *o* at time *t* iff. *B* occurs to *o* at *t*.

**Supervenience Lemma**: Mentality *supervenes* on brain states.

**Remark**: Both mind-brain correlation and supervenience are *empirical assumptions*.

### Explanations of correlation

Why A and B correlates?

1. If A and B belongs to two distinct entities (dualism), then
    a. They causally interact with each other (Cartesian Dualism)
    b. The causation has only one direction (Epiphenomenalism)
    c. They are not causally related, i.e. they have a common cause:
        - The common cause occurs only once (pre-established harmony)
        - The common cause occurs repeatedly (occasionalism, god is intervening constantly)
2. If A and B belongs to one entity (monism), then:
    a. They causally interact with each other (Property Dualism?)
    b. The causation has only one direction (Epiphenomenalism `?`)
    c. They are not causally related, because:
        - They just correlate, nothing more (Dual aspect theory, Spinoza`, token-token?`; Emergentism)
        - They are identical properties (consider lighting and thunder: they refer to one single entity `They only have epistemic difference, but identical ontologically`)

## What is Identity?

**Loose sense**: I bought the *same* book as yours (tokens belong to the same type)
**Strict sense**: a priori (2 is an even number) vs. a posteriori (water is H2O) 

**Indiscernibility Law**: If A and B are identical in the strict sense, then for any property P, P belongs to A ↔ P belongs to B 

Identity theory is typically described as "mental *events* are identical to physical *events*".

### Events as entities

There are event kinds like pain events, mental events, etc.

**Type-Type identity**: mental kind and physical kind are the same kind of event (Consider: Color is shape)

Token-Token is non-reductive, therefore may be incompatible with physicalism.


**Token-Token identity**: for any given event, it is a mental kind iff. it is a physical kind (Consider: For any object, if it has color, it has shape)

> I think the motivation for the second interpretation of event is that, it is difficult to say the criteria of pain kind if pain is multiple realizable.

### Events as exemplification of properties

Event = property + object + time
Event A = Event B means these three elements are all the same

Then there is no distinction between "Type-Type" and "Token-Token"

## Pros

### Simplicity

1. ontological simplicity: there is only one thing, not two
2. conceptual simplicity: mental language *in principle* can be translated to physical language
3. If we want to avoid identity theory, we ultimately need to accept some mind-body correlation as brute fact `isn't identity theory itself a brute fact?`

### Causally identical

Why gene is DNA molecule? This is because gene means the entity that is causally responsible for the transmission of heritable characteristics.
Why pain is C-fiber firing? This is because pain means the thing that is normally caused by tissue damage, and will normally cause winces and groans.
Therefore, mental states turns out to be physical states because they refer to the same causal role.

**Problem**: 
1. Does mental states, like pain, mean "the thing that is normally caused by tissue damage, and will normally cause winces and groans"? Or it is defined by subjective painfulness?
2. (Empirical challenge) Does C-fiber firing being thee necessary and sufficient condition for pain? What about Martians?

### Avoid Overdetermination

If it is true that all pain can be explained solely by physical causal chain, then mental cause seems redundant.

## Cons

### Problem with Token-Token

Says nothing about the relation between mental properties and physical properties, consider color and shape.

### Location Problem

If mental state does not have location in space, then mental events are not physical events.

But do mental states have locations in space?

> location must be perceived by vision. We may not have organs to perceive where that is

Felt location: A right-thumb-y sort of pain --> On right thumb
Phenomenal location: Phantom Limb

Will adding this identity alter our initial understanding of pain? A concept can change without chaining its extension.

**Answer from property exemplification account of events**: Identity of events is the identity of the objects involved. It is trivially plausible that C-fiber firing and pain happens to the same person, then the location problem is resolved. `To the same person ≠ same location! e.g. C-fiber and my skin`


### Phenomenal Properties of Mental Events

#### Sharpness of Pain

A pain can be sharp. How can C-fiber firing be sharp?

**Response**: 

Sharp is not an event kind/property exemplified. Sharp pain-kind is a subset of pain-kind.

#### Non-reductivity

Since the identity between phenomenal properties and physical properties are a posteriori, then there must exist phenomenal properties distinct from physical properties. Now when I feel, no matter how I introspect it cannot be reduced to physical properties.

This is different from "sharpness of pain" because you have to admit the existence of phenomenal properties and explain how they are perceived. Type-Type theorists must give an account of how to reduce the properties to non-mental

Similarly, we learn the meaning of pain by perceiving others get hurt and see their groaning. Then it is legitimate to reduce/translate 'pain' as 'the thing normally caused by A and normally causes B'.

> the first reduction seems a priori, and the second a posteriori. So how is Smart's and Armstrong's reduction a response, since they are just a priori?

**Response**:

"Topic neutral translation"

"Ernest is experiencing a sharp pain in his left thumb"

Smart: Something is going on in Ernest that is like *what goes on when a pin is stuck on his left thumb and groaning* 

Armstrong: Ernest is in an *internal state* apt to be caused by a pin stuck in his left thumb and apt to groan. `functionalism?`


### Non-rigid Designator

For any contingent identity statement, there must be at least one non-rigid designator. Therefore:

(i) Either, pain = C-fiber firing is contingent and thus at least one is non-rigid, *--this would be Smart's and Armstrong's approach; but if pain is the proper name for painfulness, then it is rigid;* or
(2) pain = C-fiber firing is necessary *--but it is conceivable that pain occur without C-fiber firing*

> What does "a property be rigid/non-rigid" mean?


### Multiple Realization

Can't creatures without C-fiber have pain?
