1. Empiricists: ethics is purely based on community consensus; Clear case when abortion seems good and clear case when abortion seems bad prima facie
2. Rationalists: ethics is built on "given the best reasons that support P and not P and right mental condition, every one would in principle agree that P instead of not P"

But what is right mental condition? Are these suspicious thought experiment a part of argument? It seems so? But then what is the right mental condition.
