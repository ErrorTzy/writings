# Handout: Summary of "The Normativity of Tradition" by Samuel Scheffler

## Main Question Addressed
- **What is the normative force of traditional reasons, and do they have independent significance beyond the reductive dilemma?**
  - Scheffler explores whether the fact that an action is called for by a tradition provides a genuine reason to perform it, distinct from other types of reasons.

## The Solution Being Criticized: The Reductive Dilemma
- **Description**: Scheffler criticizes a "reductive dilemma" that challenges the normative force of traditional reasons. It posits two possibilities:
  1. **Horn 1**: Acting for traditional reasons is merely doing something because others have done it in the past. This is seen as empty since "the mere fact that people have acted some way in the past is not by itself a reason to act that way in the future."
     - Example: If every past action were a reason, we’d have reasons to repeat everything ever done, which is absurd.
  2. **Horn 2**: Traditional reasons are just responses to values or principles embodied in the tradition, making the tradition itself unnecessary. The normative force comes from the values, not the tradition.
     - Example: A non-participant could act on the same values (e.g., charity) as a tradition’s adherent without needing the tradition.

## Reason for Criticism
- **Why It Fails**: Scheffler argues the dilemma oversimplifies and overlooks the unique normative force of traditions. It misses how traditions, as collaborative, intergenerational enterprises, generate reasons that depend on their existence, not reducible to past behavior or abstract values alone.
  - The first horn dismisses any normative depth, while the second ignores the tradition’s role in shaping and contextualizing those values.

## Scheffler’s Suggestion
- **Proposal**: Traditional reasons have genuine normative force due to multiple considerations that arise from the nature of traditions as collective, enduring practices. These reasons are not empty nor redundant but depend on the tradition’s existence.
- **Key Argument**: Traditions provide a variety of practical reasons—beyond mere imitation or value-based reasoning—rooted in their social, temporal, and personal significance.

## Key Considerations Supporting Traditional Reasons
Scheffler identifies twelve considerations, divided into two groups: seven initial ones and five time-related ones.

### Initial Considerations (Section 2)
1. **Convention**
   - **Point**: Traditions establish social conventions that coordinate behavior and facilitate interaction.
   - **Development**: Conventions solve coordination problems, making social life smoother.
   - **Example**: "A religious tradition may establish a sabbatarian practice which designates one day each week as a day of rest," coordinating community rest days.
   - **Defense**: This provides practical benefits, like shared rest, not achievable without the tradition.

2. **Habit**
   - **Point**: Traditions embody collective habits that enhance deliberative efficiency.
   - **Development**: Habits reduce the need for repeated decision-making by relying on past success.
   - **Example**: "Suppose that the people in a given community always go to the beach on a certain holiday," saving deliberation effort.
   - **Defense**: Efficiency is a practical advantage unique to established collective practices.

3. **Wisdom**
   - **Point**: Traditions are repositories of accumulated experience and judgment.
   - **Development**: Long-standing practices reflect historical wisdom beyond individual capacity.
   - **Defense**: Adherents gain access to collective knowledge, giving reasons to follow tradition.

4. **Guidance**
   - **Point**: Traditions interpret and apply values, reducing individual deliberative burden.
   - **Development**: They specify how and when to enact "imperfect" duties (those without fixed timing).
   - **Example**: "Many traditions establish conventions concerning the timing and proper amount of charitable giving," clarifying vague obligations.
   - **Defense**: This practical guidance depends on the tradition’s structure, not just the values.

5. **Value**
   - **Point**: Traditions themselves can be valuable, like cultural artifacts, giving reasons to adhere.
   - **Development**: Valuing a tradition (beyond recognizing its value) motivates action.
   - **Defense**: This reason hinges on the tradition’s existence as an object of value, not reducible to its principles.

6. **Loyalty**
   - **Point**: Adhering to a tradition expresses loyalty to past adherents who valued it.
   - **Development**: Loyalty ties current actions to historical actors, reinforced by traditions endorsing loyalty.
   - **Defense**: This relational reason requires the tradition’s intergenerational continuity.

7. **Integrity**
   - **Point**: For those who internalize a tradition’s values, adherence is part of personal integrity.
   - **Development**: Traditions shape self-conception, making deviation feel like self-betrayal.
   - **Defense**: This personal normative force depends on the tradition’s formative role.

### Time-Related Considerations (Sections 3-5)
Scheffler builds these by first analyzing personal routines (e.g., "going to the same café and orders the same coffee and pastry every morning") and then showing how traditions extend these functions collectively.

8. **Quasi-Mobility in Time**
   - **Point**: Traditions compensate for our lack of temporal control, making actions feel timeless or connected across generations.
   - **Development**: Unlike personal routines, traditions link to past and future adherents.
   - **Example**: Performing a ritual "as others acted before she was born and will act after she is dead" feels like time travel.
   - **Defense**: This quasi-mobility requires the tradition’s temporal span.

9. **Domesticating Time**
   - **Point**: Traditions provide temporal structures that make time feel familiar and comforting.
   - **Development**: They establish rhythms (e.g., holidays, rituals) with collective richness.
   - **Example**: "Great traditions… establish calendars, holidays and festivals, seasonal practices and ceremonies."
   - **Defense**: The social scale of these structures exceeds personal routines, enhancing comfort.

10. **Assuring Temporal Reality**
    - **Point**: Participation confirms one’s persistence through collective recognition.
    - **Development**: Joint participation in rituals reinforces self-persistence beyond personal acts.
    - **Example**: Others recognizing one’s role in shared rites (e.g., public ceremonies).
    - **Defense**: The tradition’s collective nature provides external validation.

11. **Enhancing Life’s Significance**
    - **Point**: Being part of a custodial chain of value adds meaning to one’s life (backward-looking).
    - **Development**: One inherits and preserves values, connecting to the past.
    - **Defense**: This significance stems from the tradition’s intergenerational purpose.

12. **Diminishing Death’s Significance**
    - **Point**: Ensuring valued things survive beyond one’s life reduces mortality’s impact (forward-looking).
    - **Development**: Traditions perpetuate values post-death, easing existential concerns.
    - **Defense**: This requires the tradition’s forward continuity.

## Supporting Arguments
- **Personal Routines as a Foundation**: Scheffler uses routines to show how repetition addresses time-related issues (mobility, domestication, persistence). Traditions amplify these with collective, intergenerational dimensions.
- **Valuing Beyond Self**: Traditions satisfy the impulse to care about things beyond oneself, linking past preservation and future survival, which personal routines cannot achieve alone.

## Political Implications
- **Normative Diversity**: Unlike cultural reasons (reducible per Scheffler’s prior work), traditional reasons are distinct. Liberal societies should accommodate this diversity, beyond individual convictions, due to traditions’ collaborative nature.

## Clarifications and Nuances
- **Non-Universality**: Not all need traditions; not all traditions are good.
- **Disadvantages**: Traditions can reinforce hierarchy or stifle change (e.g., oppressive practices).
- **Balance**: Traditions evolve, balancing continuity and adaptation.
- **Perception**: Adherents may not articulate these reasons but still feel their normative pull.

## Conclusion
- **Rejection of Dilemma**: Traditional reasons are neither empty nor redundant but depend on traditions’ unique features.
- **Significance**: Traditions address deep human concerns—social coordination, temporal orientation, and value preservation—making them normatively significant.
