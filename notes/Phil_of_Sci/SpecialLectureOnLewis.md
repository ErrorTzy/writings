Normal account: completely description, logical consistency
Lewis: all worlds are "concrete", all the differences here are just the actual world is actual and other possible worlds are not actual

de re modality: counterpart relations

What is the truth maker for "Katie could have worn a white shirt"? We need "transworld identify", but the relation between black Katie and white Katie is not identity relation

How you figure out modality is to look at the actual work, i. e. the truthmaker is not the (metaphysical) possible worlds

counterfactuals
de re modality
causation
necessity
universals

Science Stuff

Traditional empiricist: positivism
Spirit of empiricism: the truthmakers are all accessible for us (actual and observable)

Humian Empiricism mottos

1. no (metaphysical)necessary connections between (non-identical)distinct existences
2. all knowledge comes from experiences

Katie's version of Lewis: deeply committed to this by positing modal realism: necessity is a quantifier quantified over all (real) possible world; therefore it deflates metaphysical necessity; In this way of saying necessity there is no such thing as "necessary connection"

> No necessary causation?

Humian Supervenience (term from Lewis)

If you fix a group of local properties, all properties are fixed

Lewis: humian supervenience is contingent because it is just a natural law of our world; This is somewhat "a working hypothesis" and let us see how far it could go
