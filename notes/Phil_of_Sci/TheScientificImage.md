> Van Fraassen: Pro-theology(Kirkegaardian flavor, faith is okay), against metaphysics, pro-small-science

## 1 Introduction

The old days
Realists: Regularities in the natural phenomena must have a reason, and the reason is sought in causal properties (i.e. form of substances)
Nominalists: Deny the reality of these properties, thereby rejecting such explanation.

near-modern days: 
By not postulating such causal properties, scientists escaped this dilemma. For example, Boyle thinks all qualities can be produced by mechanical process of **tiny unobservable stuff**

Van Fraassen's objection: 
1. Metapysical problem: You still need to assume atoms, and when you try to explain the atoms' behavior, you run into the same dilemma again.
2. Epistemic Problem: Phenomena does not decide truth or falsity of a theory

This lead to the development of logical positivism.

philosophy of science now:
1. fundamental, content and structure of theories
2. relations between theory and world/users

On (1): Generally agreed that:
1. theories account for phenomena by postulating other processes and structures not directly accessible to observation
2. a system is described by its all possible states

On (2):
2.1: Relation between world and theory: Empiricists: aiming at true account of observables, do not need to give a true account about unobservables.

Problem with logical positivism: went too far in the attempt to turn philosophical problems into problems about language. 
Problem with scientific realism: reifying whatever cannot be defined away

2.2: What it is to accept a scientific theory
Both an epistemic problem and a pragmatic problem.

Scientific realism is growing, but I am going to do a revolution on behalf of empiricists.

## 2 Arguments Concerning Scientific Realism

### 1. Scientific Realism and Constructive Empiricism

#### 1.1 Statement of scientific realism

Naive statement: The picture which science give us of the world is a true one, faithful in its details and the entities postulated in science really exist; Scientific advances are discoveries not inventions

Problem: It follows that today's theories are correct

Good points: answers two questions:

1. What a scientific theory is: on what there is
2. What a scientific theory does: discovery instead of invention

Developed account: 

1. What a scientific theory aims at: give a literally true story of what the world is like; 
2. Acceptance of a theory: the belief being true (does not need to be justified)

#### 1.2 Alternative to Realism

Alternative then obviously would be:

1. aim of science: no need to be a literally true story, it just need to have some virtues (empirical adequacy, comprehensiveness, etc.)
2. acceptance: less or other than having true belief

> Two questions: 
> how should we construe science (literal or not), and how should we believe them (Fraassen: just believe the empirical part to be true)
> When we believe something:
> 1. It does not mean anything at all (about the world). It is just pragmatics
> 2. it means that the world just works in this way
> 3. The observable part works in this way, but the other parts are just pragmatics (Van Fraassen)
> 
> ==How to analyze realism in general:== 
> 1. how to construe theories, and
> 2. the epistemic position


Literal construal: one should take theories literally?
Yes: Realists (and it is true); Anti-realists (and it does not have to be true)
No: Positivists (actually mean observable statements), Instrumentalists
Difference, if P and Q are literally construed and contradicts each other, then only one can be true

#### 1.3 Constructive Empiricism

Literal construal requirement for a statement does not entail the statement to be true. Therefore it is possible to maintain the literal requirement without being a realist

Constructive Empiricism:

1. aim of science: give literal theories which are empirically adequate (about what is observable is true)
2. acceptance: belief that is empirically adequate, which in turns means:
	- epistemic dimension: commitment to confront future phenomena by means of the conceptual resource of this theory
	- pragmatic dimension: same as the realists

### 2. the Theory/Observation 'Dichotomy'

Maxwell: 

- against Carnap, observable/theoretical dichotomy is obscure
- distinction between observing and observing that

Maxwell: 

1. where should we draw the line? 
	- Van Fraassen: but there are clear cases and clear counter-cases.
2. what does "can" mean? Observable in principle? But if we have very different organs, everything is observable
	- Van Fraassen: but you can't have different organs and still talk about observability
3. Even if such distinction holds, it means nothing. Why being observable or not have anything to do with their existence?
	- Van Fraassen: But it has something to do with the proper epistemic attitude. We just do not believe they exist. Science don't need you to believe this. If our observation organs changes, or our community changes (different creatures with different organs), what exists will change. ==why?==

> Problem of circularity: the response 2.2 says "observation" depends on human limit, but human limit is informed by science
### 3. Inference to the best explanation 

Sellars, Smart, Harman: Rational inference (principle of inference to the best explanation) entails scientific realism.

**ITBE Rule**: we should infer H whether rather than H' exactly if H is a better explanation of E than H it is

Two objections that EA also follow from the rule:

1. Ordinary experience does not necessarily confirm ITBE rule. It also confirms it's rival

if we are following some rules, it means that we are willing to believe whatever follows from the rule; ITBE rule gains its plausibility from empirical observation of our psychology. Then I now formulate a rival of ITBE rule: we are willing to believe that if a theory empirically adequate then it best explains the evidence. There is no reason to decide between the anti-realists' variant and the original ones

2. To choose between rival ITBE, you need extra premises

### 4. Limits of the demand for explanation 

**Realist**: Science is unfinished as long as any pervasive regularity is left unexplained
	- **Objection**: If this is true, then it leads to hidden variables. But quantum mechanics denies hidden variables.

**Smart**: Only realism (in contrast of "instrumentalism") can distinguish between correctness and usefulness. You need this distinction because, to explain some theory to be useful, you need a correct theory as explanan. E.g. The usefulness of Ptolemaic hypothesis is explained by Copernican hypothesis being true
	- **Objection**: We can say that Copernican hypothesis explains the usefulness because it accurately describes the motions of the planets. Copernican hypothesis does not have to be true.
	- **Defense**: What explains the accuracy of the description?
		- **Nominalists' Objection**: This is just brute fact. There's no further explanation.
		- **Defense**: Consider a theory $T$ that postulate micro-structure, and $T'$ which is the macro-phenomena derived from $T$. What would explain $T'$ success? If we take empirical adequacy as the standard, then we should say that $T'$ is successful miraculously.
		- **VF's Objection**: As long as there is some restriction of what count as basic brute fact(regularities), this problem can be solved. Coincidence does not mean that there's no explanation.

### 5. The principle of the Common Cause

**Reichenbach's principle (informal)**: If two sorts of events are correlated, then either one causes the other, or there are some common cause. If there's no observable common cause, then there must be some unobservable events.
	- **Objection**: It cannot be a principle of general science at all, and it is compatible with anti-realism.

Introduction to Reichenbach's principle: probabilistic turn of modern physics; No longer seeking deterministic natural laws, but to seek a probabilistic common cause.

*Why cannot be a principle of general science?*

**Definition**: 
- $P(A)$ is the probability of $A$ occurs;
- $P(A\&B)$ is the probability of $A$ and $B$ both occurs;
- The probability of $A$ given that $B$ occurs $\frac{P(A\&B)}{P(B)}$, if $P(B) \neq 0$. We write this as $P(A / B)$
- Given that $P(A),P(B) \neq 0$, $B$ and $A$ have positive correlation iff $P(A/B)> P(A)$ (or $P(B/A)>P(B)$)

Positive correlation is symmetric, thus we still don't know if $A$ causes $B$, or $B$ causes $A$, or there's a common cause. Now if there is a $C$ that can "de-correlate" $A$ and $B$, then $C$ is the common cause, i.e. $P(A\&B/C)=P(A/C)$

**Objection**: In an indeterministic complete system, $S$ causes $F_{1},...,F_{i}$ and $G_{1},...,G_{i}$ equally. We have $P(G_n/S)=P(F_n/S)=\frac{1}{n}$, and $P(F_n=G_n/S)=1$. Now $P(F_n/S)\cdot P(G_n/S)=\frac{1}{n^2}$, $P(F_n\&G_n/S)=P(F_n/S)=\frac{1}{n}$. Therefore either the system is deterministic, or S is not a common cause. But the system is already complete. Therefore either you can't have a indeterministic complete system, or Reichenbach's principle is wrong.
- **Defense**: One can modify this indeterministic complete system. One can postulate some hidden variable.
- **Objection**: This is not how modern physics works

**Salmon**: modify$P(A\&B/C)=P(A/C)\cdot P(B/C)$ into $P(A\&B/C)>P(A/C)\cdot P(B/C)$
- **Objection**: this collapsed to the original if we want to explain something fully. If you admit we do not want to explain something fully, then you need to admit brute correlation.

*Why it is compatible with anti-realism?*

Anti-realists can admit common cause as long as it 
- aids the search for observables. 
- help build models

### 6. Limits to Explanation: A Thought Experiment

Sellars is the leader of the return of realism.

Something right about Sellars:

**Positivists**: "levels picture," i.e. facts, empirical law and theory. 
- **Sellars' objection**: theories do not explain empirical laws. Empirical laws are explainable only when under theoretical restrictions.

Something wrong about Sellars: Observation is inferior. The aim of science is to unveil the unobservables behind.

**Sellars' argument**: If different samples of gold dissolves in aqua regia at different rates, and there are no observable difference in the gold samples. Now if we assume there are two kinds of micro-structure of gold, this explains the different rates. If we do not do so, we cannot explain. Since science aims at explanation, science must postulate unobservables.
- **Objection 1**: The postulated unobservables will have observable consequences.
- **Objection 2**: Science does not need to explain everything.
- **Defense of 2**: Yes. Science only explains the cases where it is consistent to add variables. If the observations don't allow you to add hidden variables, then you hit the wall.
	- **Objection**: You can add hidden variables to quantum mechanics as long as you deny the principle that indiscernibility of physical variables entails identity. But in practice physicists don't do that. You need explanation why. 
- **Objection 3**: There can be a different rationale for postulating the micro-structure. We are just imagining something that is not guaranteed to exist in order to come to a better theory

### 7. Demons and the Ultimate Argument

**Fictionalism**: Unobservables are indispensable, but don't have to exist
- **Positivists' objection**: According to the verification theory of meaning, there's no difference in saying something exists and something is empirically adequate.
- **Why Positivists' objection is bad**: Of course there's a difference. One says there is something, one says there's not.
	- **Positivists' reply**: If you say that, you become a prey of skepticism and have no reason to reject demons and witches.
	- **Putnam's defense (strangely)**: We can reject demons and witches but accept electrons because the former is a priori implausible, while the latter is a priori plausible, which is a leap of faith `Why it is a leap of faith? Can't you say that electrons are located in a logically sound system, but demon is not?`

**Upshot**: If choosing between two empirically equivalent requires leap of faith, then choosing between fictionalism and realist requires leap of faith

**Dummett's argument**: Realism believes sentences has objective truth value independently of our means of knowing it. They are true in virtue of the reality. Anti-realists believes statements can only be understood by reference to things that we are not certain.
- **Objection**: This is not a good way to characterize realism. This would include mathematically nominalists and exclude quantum mechanics.

**The Ultimate argument (Miracle argument)**: If scientific theories do not refer, and they are not true in virtue of there being really these entities, then the success of science would be a miracle.
- **Objection**: Science is successful because the unsuccessful ones are forgotten.

## 3. To Save the Phenomena

### 1. Models

**Definition**: Any structure that satisfy the axioms of a theory is called a model of a theory

Two inconsistency could have two set of models, one of which could be embedded into another. This "embeddedness" cannot be captured by purely syntactical approach.

==Why A0 is forgotten?==
### 2. Apparent Motion and Absolute Space

For Newton's theory $NT$, let $NT(v)$ be the theory $TN+$ the postulate that the center of gravity of the solar system has constant absolute velocity $v$. By Newton's account, he claims empirical adequacy for $TN(0)$, and if $TN(0)$ is empirically adequate, then so are all the theories $TN(v)$.

### 3. Empirical Content of Newton's Theory

What would it mean for an anti-realist to accept Newton's Theory?

It does not mean to believe the common part of $TN(v)$ because it would involve believing some absolute velocity and absolute space. To believe a theory is to believe it correctly represents the world. Therefore, the anti-realist can believe a theory to be empirically adequate but false.

The theory the anti-realist believes is $TNE$: $TN(0)$ is empirically adequate
- **Objection**: This does not seem like a physical theory, but a metalinguistic one
- **Defense**: As long as it is stated in English, then it is okay. And it can be turned into non-metalinguistic version.

### 4. Theories and Their Extensions

**Objection**: Empirically equivalent theories are different because they may have different possible extensions or implication beyond their intended domain. For example, imagine that Michelson-Morley does not produce a null outcome, but a force $F(v)$. Then this would falsifies $TN(w)$ such that $w \neq v$.
**Defense**: No, $F(v)$ is consistent with any $TN(w)$ with the charged bodies at a speed $w+v$.

==This only proves that you can't distinguish TN(v) in this thought experiment. But you did not prove that there is always a way to adjust the TN to make them empirically adequate==

### 5. Extensions: Victory And Qualified Defeat

*Victorious Extension*

**Proposition**: For a set of empirically equivalent theory $S$, if $\forall x \in S$ such that $Extension(x)$ is victorious, then $\forall x,y \in S$, $Extension(x)$ and $Extension(y)$ are also empirically equivalent.

**Proof**: For an extension to be victorious, $Appearance(Extension(x))=Appearance(x)$

**Objection**: I mean the extension which appearance are different
**Defense**: Then the old theory is not empirically adequate.

*Qualified Defeat Extension*

**Objection**: Some theories may be more flexible. If the result of some experiment came out otherwise, then some theories could also adapt while some couldn't. Therefore they are different in terms of adaptability
**Defense**: This is pragmatic superiority. It has nothing to do with empirical content. Therefore they are pragmatically different but empirically equivalent.

==Why not accept pragmatically superior theory?==

### 6. Failure of the Syntactic Approach

An account of what does it mean to be empirically adequate:

**Tentative account**: Observational vocab (E) vs. Theoretical vocab distinction; A theory T expressed in E is the observational consequence of T, written as T/E. If T/E and T'/E are the same, then T and T' are empirically equivalent.
- **Objection 1**: Is T/E axiomatizable?
- **Defense to 1**: Some logicians says that, given some specific condition, yes.
- **Objection 2**: The distinction between observational vs theoretical vocab is untenable because scientific terms is linked with observation.
- **Defense to 2**: We introduce old vocab vs. new vocab distinction.
	- **Objection**: You cannot distinguish empirical import form other part of a theory just in terms of vocab. We can still express unobservables in terms of observational vocab and negations. For example, absolute space neither has a position nor occupies a volume. You will reduce everything into E, not just the observable parts.
- **Objection 3**: Even if this distinction holds, it is too broad. T/E and T'/E could be the same even if T and T' are totally different. ==why that's a problem? Two theories of course can be different but empirically equivalent. Why is it too broad?==
- **Defense to 3**: We modify the condition to, T and T' are empirically equivalent iff adding some axioms A to them, (T+A)/E=(T'+A)/E still holds.
	- **Objection**: Then TN(0), TN(E) and other TN(v) will no longer be equivalent. A possible scenario is shown in section 4

**Summary**: This is not to say that syntactic approach is impossible, but it is highly unlikely. Even we could specify E, it seems untranslatable to natural language. We should not struggle with languages.

### 7. The Hermeneutic Circle

**Another Defense to 2**: The observable/unobservable distinction is a philosophical one.
- **Objection**: This is an empirical one.
- **Defense**: This will lead to circularity: The observables are defined by a specific theory, and then we use the notion of observable to define empirical adequacy
	- **Objection**: What is observable is theory-independent. How? What is observable is determined by our organism, and we have "folk-psychology" to determine what is observable. Science provides translation from folk-psychology to scientific language but does not determine what is observable in folk-psychology.

Definition (Quantity)

: A quantity is a property that can be measured and given a numerical value

**General theory of measurement**: $Y$ is a measurement apparatus for quantity $A$ if

1. System $Y$ has a certain ground-state $Y_{g}$
2. $Y_{g}$ interacts with system $X$ in any of its possible states under some law
3. There is a correlation between quantity $B$ in the combined system $X+Y$ and quantity $A$ in $X$

**The task of science**: describe the physical system, and describe the anthropocentric distinctions `i.e. provide the translation from theoratical language to anthropocentric language`

### 8. Limits to Empirical Description

**Objection**: Since science cannot be translated to statements that describe only what the observable phenomena are like without remainder, empiricism cannot do justice to science.
**Defense**: It's true that there are limitation of observation.  But that's a feature not a bug.

**Examples**: 

1. In newton mechanics, we may define mass as a non-primitive quantity, and can only be calculated by basic observables. But some objects actually have never accelerated and therefore we never know the mass. Therefore, whether you say they have mass or not is empirically equivalent. (counterfactual is also not observable, so we cannot say it would have some mass in some counterfactual situation)
2. In quantum mechanics, rotating $2 \pi$ to a system does not change the probability distribution of any measurement result. But a rotated system is different from the original one if there is a superposition with another system. Therefore, for a system that rotated $2 \pi$ and never interact with a another system in the actual world, whether you say it changed or not is empirically equivalent.

 These examples tell us that, there are limitations of observation. We cannot uniquely determine everything just by observables anyway.

###  9. A New Picture of Theories

**The old picture (axiomatic way)**: To present a theory, you specify 

1. an exact language, 
2. some set of axioms, and 
3. a partial dictionary that related the theoretical jargon to the observed phenomena which are reported.

**The new picture**: To present a theory is 

1. to specify a family of structures, namely *models*, and
2. to specify substructure (the *empirical structures*) of those models as candidates for the direct representation of observable phenomena (*appearances*)

Definition (empirical adequacy)

: A theory is empirically adequate iff there is some model in it such that its empirical structure is isomorphic to at least all appearances

**Example**: The "axioms" of quantum mechanics are actually using the new picture because:
-  **Model way**: Uses *pre-defined mathematical objects* (like vectors and operators) to directly present a structure that represents physical systems.
 - **Axiom way**: *Introduces basic (new) terms and their relations* through axioms, then builds a structure by logically deducing more statements from them.

> Q: A model must map observables to mathematical structure, or there seems no difference between defining unobservables with some structure and presenting unobservables with some structure?
> A: You can still define an unobservable in the model approach as long as it is not preliminary

Some points to clarify:

1. **Incompleteness**: A description does not need to be complete. Electricity can be embedded to classical mechanics because the description of electricity does not enter the description of classical mechanics but is coherent with it.
2. **Unintended Realizations**: A system of mechanics may happen to a system of optics. This is possible, and there's no need to add intended phenomena to a theory because in a complex situation where mechanics and optics are combined the theory will collapse.
3. This book does not concern the structure of physical theory, but Van Fraassen prefer *the state-space approach* rather than *the set-theoretic structure approach*
4. This is a bit idealized; In practice the family of models are not carefully described unless some paradox threatens
5. A theory can be watered down by admitting new models or designating some new parts as empirical substructure in the old models. We may define the *empirically minimal* theory as the least watered-down one. 
6. But empirical minimality is not a virtue because some metaphysical baggage may have potentialities for future use, e. g. hidden variable models. `consider qualified defeat`

To accept a theory is either claim its truth or to claim its empirical adequacy; The latter is weaker and assumes less. ==Is there a self-referential problem? You are claiming some minimalism for science, and you say minimalism is not a virtue==

## 4. Empiricism and Scientific Methodology

> How to stick science and the world? Van Fraassen: use organism

Four main questions

1. Does the rejection of realism leads to self-defeating skepticism?
2. Does the methodology of science require realism?
3. Is the ideal of the unity of science intelligible on an empiricist view?
4. What sense can we make of theoretical virtues (simplicity, coherence, etc) that are not reducible to empirical adequacy or strength?

### 1. Empiricist Epistemology and Skepticism

**Objection**: If we insist that the evidence for a theory never confirms a theory to be true, what a piece of evidence can confirm never goes beyond itself. But in everyday life, we do arrive at conclusions that go beyond the evidence we have
**Defense**: I still go beyond the evidence by claiming a theory is empirically adequate in the future. And confirming empirical structure by observable entities is already ampliative.


**Objection**: observable objects are just postulated entities from sense experience or sense data. Observable are grounded by sense-data.
**Defense**: No. Sense data is the postulated entity from observable objects

- **Objection**: The conclusion of empirical adequacy is confirmed by observables is still beyond the evidence. What are the conditions for rationally accepting the conclusion beyond evidence, then? ==why go beyond evidence but not so beyond as to say the theory is true? Katie: taking risk without talking about beliefs, just talking about acceptance, in some sense minimize the risk. But why so?==


### 2. Methodology and Experimental Design

#### 2.1 The Roles of Theory

**Traditional view**: Everything is subordinate to the aim of knowing the structure of the world; experiments are designed to test these theories

**Problem**: contrasts sharply with the activity Kuhn has termed "normal science" which needs the construction of theories and previous constructed theories that guide experimental inquiry

**role of experimentation**

1. constructs the theory by *filling in blanks*, and 
2. *verify* the empirical adequacy of a theory

**Role of Theory**

1. formulate the questions to be answered, and
2. help design the experiment

==A circular explanation? Why experiments are good? Because they do good to theories. Why theories are good? Because they do good to experiments.==

#### 2.2 Measuring the Charge of the Electron

- **Theory testing**: the theory predicts the outcome, and experiment test the outcome
- **Discovery:** The theory posits some missing factor (blank), and experiment discover what it is (fill in the blank)

**Objection**: What are the experimental scientists doing when they make a discovery, if the thing being discovered does not exist?
**Defense**: They are give answer to: Assuming that the theory is empirically adequate, how the blank is to be filled; In other words, they are just developing the model

**Example**: Millikan's oil drop experiment is filling a value for a quantity which was left open.

Therefore, experiment is the *continuation of theory construction by other means*, aiming at empirical adequacy.

#### 2.3 Boyd on the Philosophical Explanation of Methodology

**Boyd**: Only scientific realism can help us make sense of why theory can guide experimental design

**Objection 1**: Anti-realism is false because it adopts the following principle: If two theories have exactly the same deductive observational consequences, then any experimental evidence for or against one of them is evidence of the same force for or against the other. The principle is trivially false if both have no observation predicates at all or the consequences are all tautological; ==Why? Is there any example?==

- **Defense**: It is immune to Boyd's objection if I modify it into "any two empirically equivalent theories are equally supported or contravened by the evidence" ==why?==

**Objection 2**: The following principle is uncontroversial

1. Suppose that some principle of scientiﬁc methodology contributes to the reliability of that methodology in the following minimal sense: that its operation contributes to the likelihood that the observational consequences of accepted scientiﬁc theories will be (at least approximately) true. Then it is the business of scientiﬁc epistemology to *explain* the reliability of that principle `If a rule in scientific methodology increases the chances that the observable predictions of accepted theories are true (or close to true), then philosophers of science should explain why that rule is reliable`

In specific, (P) is an instance rule of what this principle describes, and philosophers need to explain why this is reliable.

(P) a proposed theory T must be experimentally tested under situations representative of those in which, in the light of collateral information, it is most likely that T will fail, if it's going to fail at all. `Pressure testing for L: find the cases where L fails it would produce different outcome`

**Objection**: (P) is plausible, and only realism can follow (P) because you need causal claims made by the theory might plausibly go wrong

**Defense**: The pressure testing will confirm L to be empirically adequate as against contemplated alternatives

#### 2.4 Phenomenology of Scientific Activity

We are immersed to theoretical language, how do we explain it without ontological commitment?

**Old way**: philosophy distinguish theoretical and non-theoretical vocabulary from outside

**Van Fraassen's way**: the conceptual framework of science itself distinguish observables and unobservables; and it *correlates* the what we perceive but it does not need to be metaphysical

When we are immersed in the world picture, we seems to see electron and racehorse as both objectively existence. But this is not qualified. "Living in a theoretical world" does not describe one's commitments. Is it only possible to distinguish observables and unobservable after we are immersed in the scientific world. The "stepping one step away and examine one's epistemic commitments" is a reflective attitude.

`i.e. the theoretic vs observable distinction is an epistemic, reflective distinction`

### 3. The Conjunction Objection

**Problem**: In scientific practice, if theory A and theory B are both accepted, then we put these two theories together to expend them to new domain of prediction. How should we describe this phenomenon?

**First Objection**: Putting the two theories together means to accept the conjunction of the two theory. The conjunction of two theories is not intelligible on an anti-realist view. 

**Example**

Let A, C be observable phenomena, and $\alpha$ be unobservable process.

- Theory 1:
	1. If A is observed, then there is $\alpha$.
	2. C will be observed iff there is  $\alpha$
- Theory 2:
	1. If A is observed, then there is no $\alpha$.
	2. C will be observed iff there is no $\alpha$

Assume that we observe C whenever we observe A. Then Theory 1 and theory 2 are empirically adequate, but the conjunction of theory 1 and theory 2 will yield contradicting results:

(P1) A is observed
(P2) there is $\alpha$ (from 1.1) 
(C) C will be observed. (from 1.2 and P2)
(C') C will not be observed. (from 2.2 and P2)

For realists, this problem will not arise because the theories cannot be true at the same time.

==But why not just stipulate that we cannot conjoin two theories together because there are contradictions?==

**Defense**: If realists are right to say that putting together two theories is to conjoin them, and if someone accepts theory A and theory B, then they would be confident about the conjunction of A and B, and therefore the conjunction of A and B are empirically adequate. But in real scientific practices, scientists are *unsure* whether A and B is empirically adequate until they test it.

**Problem**: Scientists want a single theory to cover disparate domains of phenomena. What would explain this?

**Second Objection**: Realists can explain this by saying that, a theory cannot be true unless it can be extended consistently. But if anti-realists are happy with empirically adequate theories, then they have no reason to be unhappy with empirically adequate theories that are incompatible with each other.

**Reply 1 (Pierre Duhem)**: just give up the unity of science.

- **Objection**: This is just crazy. And it would be inconvenient if we cannot use two theories together to deal with complex situation.

**Reply 2 (BVF)**: If we don't want to say that complex situation is impossible, or we need to devise a theory for every complex situation, then requirement of empirical adequacy already demand us to be unhappy with disparate mini-theories.



### 4. Pragmatic Virtues and Explanation

#### 4.1 The other virtues

Other virtues: Elegant, simple, of great scope, unifying, explanatory

Distinction between reasons for using a theory and reasons for accepting a theory. The reasons for using a theory does not make a theory more likely to be true.

Why is it rational to pursue explanation? Because to pursue explanation is to pursue the basic merits like empirically adequacy, empirical strength, etc..

Explanatory power = Pragmatics + Empirical adequacy

#### 4.2 The Incursion of Pragmatics

Semantics is an abstraction of pragmatics. Indexicality is an example of how sometimes we cannot do this abstraction thoroughly.

==Can we approach first person pronoun in this manner?==

Natural Language has three levels:

1. Syntax: the innate property within the language itself
2. Semantics: the relation between language and the world
3. Pragmatic: the relation between language and the speakers

Semantics is an abstraction from pragmatics, though indexicality shows this cannot be done thoroughly sometimes.

Similarly, we can analyze a theory in three levels:

1. Internal properties: consistency, completeness, etc.
2. Semantic properties: relation to the world, mainly truth and empirical adequacy
3. Pragmatic properties: the explanatory power of a theory, and how we use theories to explain

==An semantic properties is an abstraction from our explanation? Ideal Explanatory text specify a model? Is there a hidden argument here that explanation is scientific practice, but semantic properties is the goal of science? What do you mean the aim of science, anyway? We know language comes into existence because we want to communicate, and it is also plausible that science comes to existence because we want explanation. Then you are saying that the aim of language is truth, not communication. This is actually a narrower view of science: some explanation may be not "scientific enough" because a false theory can explain, but that's not science==

#### 4.3 Pursuit of Explanation

**Objection**: Scientists search for better theory when they are already empirically adequate. Only realists can explain this.

**Defense**: There are always reason to doubt empirical adequacy; 

positive defense: to search for explanation for the most part is aligned with other ideals like simplicity, unification and empirical adequacy ==what???==


Explanation is not a minimal virtue: A theory cannot allow any part of it to e inconsistent, but can leave some part of it to be unexplained.
Explanation does not override empirical adequacy: We don't say we have an explanation unless we have an acceptable theory
