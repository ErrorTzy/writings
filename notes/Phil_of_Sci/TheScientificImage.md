## 1 Introduction

The old days
Realists: Regularities in the natural phenomena must have a reason, and the reason is sought in causal properties (i.e. form of substances)
Nominalists: Deny the reality of these properties, thereby rejecting such explanation.

near-modern days: 
By not postulating such causal properties, scientists escaped this dilemma. For example, Boyle thinks all qualities can be produced by mechanical process of **tiny unobservable stuff**

Van Fraassen's objection: 
1. Metapysical problem: You still need to assume atoms, and when you try to explain the atoms' behavior, you run into the same dilemma again.
2. Epistemic Problem: Phenomena does not decide truth or falsity of a theory

This lead to the development of logical positivism.

philosophy of science now:
1. fundamental, content and structure of theories
2. relations between theory and world/users

On (1): Generally agreed that:
1. theories account for phenomena by postulating other processes and structures not directly accessible to observation
2. a system is described by its all possible states

On (2):
2.1: Relation between world and theory: Empiricists: aiming at true account of observables, do not need to give a true account about unobservables.

Problem with logical positivism: went too far in the attempt to turn philosophical problems into problems about language. 
Problem with scientific realism: reifying whatever cannot be defined away

2.2: What it is to accept a scientific theory
Both an epistemic problem and a pragmatic problem.

Scientific realism is growing, but I am going to do a revolution on behalf of empiricists.

## 2 Arguments Concerning Scientific Realism

### 1. Scientific Realism and Constructive Empiricism

#### 1.1 Statement of scientific realism

Naive statement: The picture which science give us of the world is a true one, faithful in its details and the entities postulated in science really exist; Scientific advances are discoveries not inventions

Problem: It follows that today's theories are correct

Good points: answers two questions:

1. What a scientific theory is: on what there is
2. What a scientific theory does: discovery instead of invention

Developed account: 

1. What a scientific theory aims at: give a literally true story of what the world is like; 
2. Acceptance of a theory: the belief being true (does not need to be justified)

#### 1.2 Alternative to Realism

Alternative then obviously would be:

1. aim of science: no need to be a literally true story, it just need to have some virtues (empirical adequacy, comprehensiveness, etc.)
2. acceptance: less or other than having true belief

> Two questions: 
> how should we construe science (literal or not), and how should we believe them (Fraassen: just believe the empirical part to be true)
> When we believe something:
> 1. It does not mean anything at all (about the world). It is just pragmatics
> 2. it means that the world just works in this way
> 3. The observable part works in this way, but the other parts are just pragmatics (Van Fraassen)
> 
> ==How to analyze realism in general:== 
> 1. how to construe theories, and
> 2. the epistemic position


Literal construal: one should take theories literally?
Yes: Realists (and it is true); Anti-realists (and it does not have to be true)
No: Positivists (actually mean observable statements), Instrumentalists
Difference, if P and Q are literally construed and contradicts each other, then only one can be true

#### 1.3 Constructive Empiricism

Literal construal requirement for a statement does not entail the statement to be true. Therefore it is possible to maintain the literal requirement without being a realist

Constructive Empiricism:

1. aim of science: give literal theories which are empirically adequate (about what is observable is true)
2. acceptance: belief that is empirically adequate, which in turns means:
	- epistemic dimension: commitment to confront future phenomena by means of the conceptual resource of this theory
	- pragmatic dimension: same as the realists

### 2. the Theory/Observation 'Dichotomy'

Maxwell: 

- against Carnapï¼Œobservable/theoretical dichotomy is obscure
- distinction between observing and observing that

Maxwell: 

1. where should we draw the line? 
	- Van Fraassen: but there are clear cases and clear counter-cases.
2. what does "can" mean? Observable in principle? But if we have very different organs, everything is observable
	- Van Fraassen: but you can't have different organs and still talk about observability
3. Even if such distinction holds, it means nothing. Why being observable or not have anything to do with their existence?
	- Van Fraassen: But it has something to do with the proper epistemic attitude. We just do not believe they exist. Science don't need you to believe this. If our observation organs changes, or our community changes (different creatures with different organs), what exists will change. ==why?==

> Problem of circularity: the response 2.2 says "observation" depends on human limit, but human limit is informed by science
### 3. Inference to the best explanation 

Sellars, Smart, Harman: Rational inference (principle of inference to the best explanation) entails scientific realism.

**ITBE Rule**: we should infer H whether rather than H' exactly if H is a better explanation of E than H it is

Two objections that EA also follow from the rule:

1. Ordinary experience does not necessarily confirm ITBE rule. It also confirms it's rival

if we are following some rules, it means that we are willing to believe whatever follows from the rule; ITBE rule gains its plausibility from empirical observation of our psychology. Then I now formulate a rival of ITBE rule: we are willing to believe that if a theory empirically adequate then it best explains the evidence. There is no reason to decide between the anti-realists' variant and the original ones

2. To choose between rival ITBE, you need extra premises

### 4. Limits of the demand for explanation
