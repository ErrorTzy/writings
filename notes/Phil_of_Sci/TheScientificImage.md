> Van Fraassen: Pro-theology(Kirkegaardian flavor, faith is okay), against metaphysics, pro-small-science

## 1 Introduction

The old days
Realists: Regularities in the natural phenomena must have a reason, and the reason is sought in causal properties (i.e. form of substances)
Nominalists: Deny the reality of these properties, thereby rejecting such explanation.

near-modern days: 
By not postulating such causal properties, scientists escaped this dilemma. For example, Boyle thinks all qualities can be produced by mechanical process of **tiny unobservable stuff**

Van Fraassen's objection: 
1. Metapysical problem: You still need to assume atoms, and when you try to explain the atoms' behavior, you run into the same dilemma again.
2. Epistemic Problem: Phenomena does not decide truth or falsity of a theory

This lead to the development of logical positivism.

philosophy of science now:
1. fundamental, content and structure of theories
2. relations between theory and world/users

On (1): Generally agreed that:
1. theories account for phenomena by postulating other processes and structures not directly accessible to observation
2. a system is described by its all possible states

On (2):
2.1: Relation between world and theory: Empiricists: aiming at true account of observables, do not need to give a true account about unobservables.

Problem with logical positivism: went too far in the attempt to turn philosophical problems into problems about language. 
Problem with scientific realism: reifying whatever cannot be defined away

2.2: What it is to accept a scientific theory
Both an epistemic problem and a pragmatic problem.

Scientific realism is growing, but I am going to do a revolution on behalf of empiricists.

## 2 Arguments Concerning Scientific Realism

### 1. Scientific Realism and Constructive Empiricism

#### 1.1 Statement of scientific realism

Naive statement: The picture which science give us of the world is a true one, faithful in its details and the entities postulated in science really exist; Scientific advances are discoveries not inventions

Problem: It follows that today's theories are correct

Good points: answers two questions:

1. What a scientific theory is: on what there is
2. What a scientific theory does: discovery instead of invention

Developed account: 

1. What a scientific theory aims at: give a literally true story of what the world is like; 
2. Acceptance of a theory: the belief being true (does not need to be justified)

#### 1.2 Alternative to Realism

Alternative then obviously would be:

1. aim of science: no need to be a literally true story, it just need to have some virtues (empirical adequacy, comprehensiveness, etc.)
2. acceptance: less or other than having true belief

> Two questions: 
> how should we construe science (literal or not), and how should we believe them (Fraassen: just believe the empirical part to be true)
> When we believe something:
> 1. It does not mean anything at all (about the world). It is just pragmatics
> 2. it means that the world just works in this way
> 3. The observable part works in this way, but the other parts are just pragmatics (Van Fraassen)
> 
> ==How to analyze realism in general:== 
> 1. how to construe theories, and
> 2. the epistemic position


Literal construal: one should take theories literally?
Yes: Realists (and it is true); Anti-realists (and it does not have to be true)
No: Positivists (actually mean observable statements), Instrumentalists
Difference, if P and Q are literally construed and contradicts each other, then only one can be true

#### 1.3 Constructive Empiricism

Literal construal requirement for a statement does not entail the statement to be true. Therefore it is possible to maintain the literal requirement without being a realist

Constructive Empiricism:

1. aim of science: give literal theories which are empirically adequate (about what is observable is true)
2. acceptance: belief that is empirically adequate, which in turns means:
	- epistemic dimension: commitment to confront future phenomena by means of the conceptual resource of this theory
	- pragmatic dimension: same as the realists

### 2. the Theory/Observation 'Dichotomy'

Maxwell: 

- against Carnapï¼Œobservable/theoretical dichotomy is obscure
- distinction between observing and observing that

Maxwell: 

1. where should we draw the line? 
	- Van Fraassen: but there are clear cases and clear counter-cases.
2. what does "can" mean? Observable in principle? But if we have very different organs, everything is observable
	- Van Fraassen: but you can't have different organs and still talk about observability
3. Even if such distinction holds, it means nothing. Why being observable or not have anything to do with their existence?
	- Van Fraassen: But it has something to do with the proper epistemic attitude. We just do not believe they exist. Science don't need you to believe this. If our observation organs changes, or our community changes (different creatures with different organs), what exists will change. ==why?==

> Problem of circularity: the response 2.2 says "observation" depends on human limit, but human limit is informed by science
### 3. Inference to the best explanation 

Sellars, Smart, Harman: Rational inference (principle of inference to the best explanation) entails scientific realism.

**ITBE Rule**: we should infer H whether rather than H' exactly if H is a better explanation of E than H it is

Two objections that EA also follow from the rule:

1. Ordinary experience does not necessarily confirm ITBE rule. It also confirms it's rival

if we are following some rules, it means that we are willing to believe whatever follows from the rule; ITBE rule gains its plausibility from empirical observation of our psychology. Then I now formulate a rival of ITBE rule: we are willing to believe that if a theory empirically adequate then it best explains the evidence. There is no reason to decide between the anti-realists' variant and the original ones

2. To choose between rival ITBE, you need extra premises

### 4. Limits of the demand for explanation 

**Realist**: Science is unfinished as long as any pervasive regularity is left unexplained
	- **Objection**: If this is true, then it leads to hidden variables. But quantum mechanics denies hidden variables.

**Smart**: Only realism (in contrast of "instrumentalism") can distinguish between correctness and usefulness. You need this distinction because, to explain some theory to be useful, you need a correct theory as explanan. E.g. The usefulness of Ptolemaic hypothesis is explained by Copernican hypothesis being true
	- **Objection**: We can say that Copernican hypothesis explains the usefulness because it accurately describes the motions of the planets. Copernican hypothesis does not have to be true.
	- **Defense**: What explains the accuracy of the description?
		- **Nominalists' Objection**: This is just brute fact. There's no further explanation.
		- **Defense**: Consider a theory $T$ that postulate micro-structure, and $T'$ which is the macro-phenomena derived from $T$. What would explain $T'$ success? If we take empirical adequacy as the standard, then we should say that $T'$ is successful miraculously.
		- **VF's Objection**: As long as there is some restriction of what count as basic brute fact(regularities), this problem can be solved. Coincidence does not mean that there's no explanation.

### 5. The principle of the Common Cause

**Reichenbach's principle (informal)**: If two sorts of events are correlated, then either one causes the other, or there are some common cause. If there's no observable common cause, then there must be some unobservable events.
	- **Objection**: It cannot be a principle of general science at all, and it is compatible with anti-realism.

Introduction to Reichenbach's principle: probabilistic turn of modern physics; No longer seeking deterministic natural laws, but to seek a probabilistic common cause.

*Why cannot be a principle of general science?*

**Definition**: 
- $P(A)$ is the probability of $A$ occurs;
- $P(A\&B)$ is the probability of $A$ and $B$ both occurs;
- The probability of $A$ given that $B$ occurs $\frac{P(A\&B)}{P(B)}$, if $P(B) \neq 0$. We write this as $P(A / B)$
- Given that $P(A),P(B) \neq 0$, $B$ and $A$ have positive correlation iff $P(A/B)> P(A)$ (or $P(B/A)>P(B)$)

Positive correlation is symmetric, thus we still don't know if $A$ causes $B$, or $B$ causes $A$, or there's a common cause. Now if there is a $C$ that can "de-correlate" $A$ and $B$, then $C$ is the common cause, i.e. $P(A\&B/C)=P(A/C)$

**Objection**: In an indeterministic complete system, $S$ causes $F_{1},...,F_{i}$ and $G_{1},...,G_{i}$ equally. We have $P(G_n/S)=P(F_n/S)=\frac{1}{n}$, and $P(F_n=G_n/S)=1$. Now $P(F_n/S)\cdot P(G_n/S)=\frac{1}{n^2}$, $P(F_n\&G_n/S)=P(F_n/S)=\frac{1}{n}$. Therefore either the system is deterministic, or S is not a common cause. But the system is already complete. Therefore either you can't have a indeterministic complete system, or Reichenbach's principle is wrong.
- **Defense**: One can modify this indeterministic complete system. One can postulate some hidden variable.
- **Objection**: This is not how modern physics works

**Salmon**: modify$P(A\&B/C)=P(A/C)\cdot P(B/C)$ into $P(A\&B/C)>P(A/C)\cdot P(B/C)$
- **Objection**: this collapsed to the original if we want to explain something fully. If you admit we do not want to explain something fully, then you need to admit brute correlation.

*Why it is compatible with anti-realism?*

Anti-realists can admit common cause as long as it 
- aids the search for observables. 
- help build models

### 6. Limits to Explanation: A Thought Experiment

Sellars is the leader of the return of realism.

Something right about Sellars:

**Positivists**: "levels picture," i.e. facts, empirical law and theory. 
- **Sellars' objection**: theories do not explain empirical laws. Empirical laws are explainable only when under theoretical restrictions.

Something wrong about Sellars: Observation is inferior. The aim of science is to unveil the unobservables behind.

**Sellars' argument**: If different samples of gold dissolves in aqua regia at different rates, and there are no observable difference in the gold samples. Now if we assume there are two kinds of micro-structure of gold, this explains the different rates. If we do not do so, we cannot explain. Since science aims at explanation, science must postulate unobservables.
- **Objection 1**: The postulated unobservables will have observable consequences.
- **Objection 2**: Science does not need to explain everything.
- **Defense of 2**: Yes. Science only explains the cases where it is consistent to add variables. If the observations don't allow you to add hidden variables, then you hit the wall.
	- **Objection**: You can add hidden variables to quantum mechanics as long as you deny the principle that indiscernibility of physical variables entails identity. But in practice physicists don't do that. You need explanation why. 
- **Objection 3**: There can be a different rationale for postulating the micro-structure. We are just imagining something that is not guaranteed to exist in order to come to a better theory

### 7. Demons and the Ultimate Argument

**Fictionalism**: Unobservables are indispensable, but don't have to exist
- **Positivists' objection**: According to the verification theory of meaning, there's no difference in saying something exists and something is empirically adequate.
- **Why Positivists' objection is bad**: Of course there's a difference. One says there is something, one says there's not.
	- **Positivists' reply**: If you say that, you become a prey of skepticism and have no reason to reject demons and witches.
	- **Putnam's defense (strangely)**: We can reject demons and witches but accept electrons because the former is a priori implausible, while the latter is a priori plausible, which is a leap of faith `Why it is a leap of faith? Can't you say that electrons are located in a logically sound system, but demon is not?`

**Upshot**: If choosing between two empirically equivalent requires leap of faith, then choosing between fictionalism and realist requires leap of faith

**Dummett's argument**: Realism believes sentences has objective truth value independently of our means of knowing it. They are true in virtue of the reality. Anti-realists believes statements can only be understood by reference to things that we are not certain.
- **Objection**: This is not a good way to characterize realism. This would include mathematically nominalists and exclude quantum mechanics.

**The Ultimate argument (Miracle argument)**: If scientific theories do not refer, and they are not true in virtue of there being really these entities, then the success of science would be a miracle.
- **Objection**: Science is successful because the unsuccessful ones are forgotten.

## 3. To Save the Phenomena

### 1. Models

**Definition**: Any structure that satisfy the axioms of a theory is called a model of a theory

Two inconsistency could have two set of models, one of which could be embedded into another. This "embeddedness" cannot be captured by purely syntactical approach.

### 2. Apparent Motion and Absolute Space

For Newton's theory $NT$, let $NT(v)$ be the theory $TN+$ the postulate that the center of gravity of the solar system has constant absolute velocity $v$. By Newton's account, he claims empirical adequacy for $TN(0)$, and if $TN(0)$ is empirically adequate, then so are all the theories $TN(v)$.

### 3. Empirical Content of Newton's Theory

What would it mean for an anti-realist to accept Newton's Theory?

It does not mean to believe the common part of $TN(v)$ because it would involve believing some absolute velocity and absolute space. To believe a theory is to believe it correctly represents the world. Therefore, the anti-realist can believe a theory to be empirically adequate but false.

The theory the anti-realist believes is $TNE$: $TN(0)$ is empirically adequate
- **Objection**: This does not seem like a physical theory, but a metalinguistic one
- **Defense**: As long as it is stated in English, then it is okay. And it can be turned into non-metalinguistic version.

### 4. Theories and Their Extensions

**Objection**: Empirically equivalent theories are different because they may have different possible extensions or implication beyond their intended domain. For example, imagine that Michelson-Morley does not produce a null outcome, but a force $F(v)$. Then this would falsifies $TN(w)$ such that $w \neq v$.
**Defense**: No, $F(v)$ is consistent with any $TN(w)$ with the charged bodies at a speed $w+v$.

==This only proves that you can't distinguish TN(v) in this thought experiment. But you did not prove that there is always a way to adjust the TN to make them empirically adequate==

### 5. Extensions: Victory And Qualified Defeat
