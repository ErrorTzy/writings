## Chap.2 Logic Plus Empiricism

### 1. The Empiricist Tradition
Trace back to Locke, Hume and Berkeley

### 2. The Vienna Circle
Earlier: logical positivism, more intense
Later: logical empiricism, more moderate

Against: Hegel and Heidegger
Most logical positivists fled to the US during WWII

### 3. Central Ideas
1. analytic vs synthetic distinction
2. verifiability theory of meaning

If something is neither *analytic* nor *a posteriori*, then it is meaningless.

But what count as verification? Are physical objects verifying sense data or verified theory? On what exactly can be verified, there is a "tolerance" of alternative linguistic frameworks.

Philosophy's task: use logic to show how language, math and science work

### 4. Problems and Changes

some comically simple problem:
- if "Metal expand when heated" is testable, then "Metal expand when heated and the absolute spirit is perfect" is testable

Quine's objection:
- Testing is holistic. Therefore we must accept a holistic empiricism

Problem with Quine's objection: 
1. The positivists already accepted that testing is holistic.
But one thing is clear: The logical positivists did not appreciate the significance of this point.
2. Carnap has already revised the analytic-synthetic distinction. Analytic statements can be change by changing the linguistic frameworks
But Quine has a weaker but more convincing objection later in the paper, i.e. the web of belief argument, pointing that there is no *scientific sense* of making a sharp analytic-synthetic distinction

### 5. Logical Empiricism

After Quine, positivists adapted the verification theory of meaning to a holistic empiricist theory of meaning.
Hempel: to explain is to show how to infer it using a logical argument, where the premises of the argument include at least one statement of a natural law

What is the aim of science? For the logical positivists, the aim is just to detect patterns of experience. What about logical empiricists?

They want to keep this idea that the part of language that refers to unobservable entities helps us to pick out patterns in the observable realm. But they struggle to defend their thesis because in practice scientists do refer to a lot of hidden structures like electron and gene. Empiricists must then claim that these concepts are discovering subtle patterns in the observable realm, and the aim of science is *prediction* instead of *description*.

### 6. On the fall of logical empiricism

it becomes extinct by the middle or late 1970, because:

1. breakdown of the view of language
2. holistic arguments
3. failure to develop inductive logic (chap 3)
4. development of a new role for fields like history and psychology in phil of sci. (chap. 5-7)
5. pressure from scientific realism

```

Sufficient condition for science:
1. Theories
2. Confirmation/Disconfirmation

On theory:
1. Observational statement(consists of observational vocabulary): The cup is on the table
2. Theoratical statement(consists of theoratical vocabulary): All water boils at 212F

Logical Positivism: Reduce theoratical vocab to observational vocab
Problem: Very hard ==Not impossible!!!==

On Confirmation:
Hypothesis-Deduction Confirmation(HD method):
Given hypothesis, try derive observation. Now check whether we can observe such thing. If we sees the obseration, it confirms hypothesis.

to do this, for a hypothesis(electron has mass), we still need initial condition (e.g. this is an electron), auxiliary hypothesis(whatever has mass has weight on earth) to derive an observable sentence.

Problem: 
confirmation cannot be acheieved by deduction; 
disconfirmation can only say that, at least one of the hypothesis is false 

```

## Chap. 4 Popper: Conjecture and Refutation

### 1. Popper's unique place in the philosophy of science

Scientists regard popper as a hero, but has been criticized by philosophers. Anyway he is important.

### 2. Popper's theory of science

motive: understand difference between scientific theories and nonscientific theories(pseudo-science)

First attempt: falsificationism
All observations can do is to show that a theory is false. Confirmation is an impossible myth. Popper is, like Hume, an inductive skeptic.

Popper's theory is radical because we normally think observation can increase our confidence in the truth of a theory, but Popper says no. All we can say is that this theory has not been falsified yet.

If the aim of science is to seek true description of the world, how can anyone do that if confirmation is impossible?

### 3. Popper on scientific change

Stage 1: conjecture
Stage 2: attempted refutation
If a theory is refuted at stage 2, we go back to stage 1

Scientists should not cook up a new conjecture that is designed to just avoid the problems revealed by earlier testing. I.e. ad hoc is wrong. `why?`

On division of labor: it is not a good scientific behavior to have A do the conjecture and B do the refutation because if A is a good scientist, he should take a critical attitude towards his own theory. 

Problem about division of labor: an open-minded community of science can consists of close-minded scientists. What's the problem with this?

Another remark: it looks like Darwin's natural selection. This analogy is interesting, though not need to be taken seriously. It will be discussed in Chap. 6 and 11

### 4. Objections to Popper on Falsification

Something right about popper: scientific theories should take risks.
Something wrong about popper: over-simplified picture of how risk-taking works

A theory prohibits some observation from happening. But the observation is based on some assumptions, which returns to the problem of holistic testing. For example, we should not see iron contracting when heated, but based on the assumption that the thing being tested is really iron, and our measurement does not go wrong, etc. In other words, it is always possible to blame the extra assumptions for unexpected result.

Popper conceded on this and move from scientific theory to scientific behavior

The observation report can also be falsified, since it is based on assumptions.Then you need to decide whether this observation count as a refutation. Then what is the difference between deciding a theory is wrong directly, and deciding a theory is wrong by observation? Also popper did not provide reason why we should not cling to a theory and dismiss conflicting observations.

Popper's theory is revised into: a scientific theory is falsifiable via a certain kind of decision, and pseudo-science is immune to any possible observations.

Still a problem: why is this so?

Another problem:
what about some theories that claims some observations are unlikely? For example, it is unlikely that you get 100 times of head when you toss 100 times of coin. Popper's response is that, you need to decide how low chance should be considered as improbable so that when unexpected observation happens the theory is falsified. But this breaks the initial picture that observation can falsify theories on grounds of deductive logic.

### 5. Objections to Popper on confirmation

If we have two theories: (i) already tested several times and not falsified; (ii) a new theory that have not been tested, how should we choose between these two?

Popper coined the property "corroboration" to measure which theory should we choose. But what sort of property is "corroboration"? If it is not confirmation, then why would we pick one over another?
