Sufficient condition for science:
1. Theories
2. Confirmation/Disconfirmation

On theory:
3. Observational statement(consists of observational vocabulary): The cup is on the table
4. Theoratical statement(consists of theoratical vocabulary): All water boils at 212F

Logical Positivism: Reduce theoratical vocab to observational vocab
Problem: Very hard ==Not impossible!!!==

On Confirmation:

**Hypothesis-Deduction Confirmation(HD method)**:
Given hypothesis, try derive observation. Now check whether we can observe such thing. If we sees the obseration, it confirms hypothesis.

to do this, for a hypothesis(electron has mass), we still need initial condition (e.g. this is an electron), auxiliary hypothesis(whatever has mass has weight on earth) to derive an observable sentence.

Problem: 
confirmation cannot be achieved by deduction; 
disconfirmation can only say that, at least one of the hypothesis is false 

incremental confirmation vs. absolute confirmation

**Qualitative Confirmation**: it does not tell you *how much* the hypothesis is confirmed.
