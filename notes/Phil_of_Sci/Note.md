Sufficient condition for science:
1. Theories
2. Confirmation/Disconfirmation

On theory:
3. Observational statement(consists of observational vocabulary): The cup is on the table
4. Theoratical statement(consists of theoratical vocabulary): All water boils at 212F

Logical Positivism: Reduce theoratical vocab to observational vocab
Problem: Very hard ==Not impossible!!!==

### On Confirmation:


1st candidate: **Hypothesis-Deduction Confirmation(HD method)**:
Given hypothesis, try derive observation. Now check whether we can observe such thing. If we sees the obseration, it confirms hypothesis.

to do this, for a hypothesis(electron has mass), we still need initial condition (e.g. this is an electron), auxiliary hypothesis(whatever has mass has weight on earth) to derive an observable sentence.

Problem: 
confirmation cannot be achieved by deduction; 
disconfirmation can only say that, at least one of the hypothesis is false 

incremental confirmation vs. absolute confirmation

**Qualitative Confirmation**: it does not tell you *how much* the hypothesis is confirmed.

--> Special case of HD method: 
**Nicod's criterion** All F that's G confirms (at least a bit) that "All Fs are Gs"

**Equivalence Condition**: If H and K are logically equivalent, then anything confirms H also confirms K

Also, we know that ""All Fs are Gs" is equivalent to "All non-Gs are non-Fs "

#### Hempel's Ravens Paradox: 

Consider the hypothesis "All ravens are black." We have "All things that are not black are not ravens." According to Nicod's criterion, a white shirt confirms "All ravens are black."

Answer: A white shirt does confirms it in that it rules out a possibility to falsify the hypothesis.

**Tentative solution**: confirmation depends on how much samples in the total set have you tested

Problem 1: We are very certain that cooper is conducted, but how many copper have we tested in the universe?

**Hempel's solution**: Confirmation is context-sensitive. Confirmation only occurs in the context in which hypothesis hold up to *epistemic risk.* A white shirt is not an evidence in the context where the hypothesis is not a risk; But if you don't know it is a shirt and it flew over you and you thought it might be a raven, then it would threat the hypothesis that "all ravens are black". In this case, since the hypothesis is at risk, this count as a evidence.

Problem 2: Positive instance may not confirm.

All humans are under 11 feet tall
You see a human that is 10.999 feet tall
This is a positive instance, but you seems less confident, that's because we have some background knowledge about our chance of meeting a 10.999 ft tall is almost the same as 11 ft

**Solution 3**: There is no general reason to suppose that Nicod's criterion is true. Whether or not F is a G confirms "All F's are G" depends on our background knowledge regarding the situation

**Converse Converse Condition(CCC)**

**Absolute CCC** If H entails K, and K is absolutely confirmed by E, then H is absolutely confirmed given E

**Absolute CCC is wrong** For example: all man are mortal entails Socrates is moral; Confirming Socrates being mortal is not confirming all men are mortal.

**Incremental CCC** If H entails K, and K is incrementally confirmed by E, then H is incrementally confirmed given E

**Incremental CCC is wrong** in the same way absolute CCC is wrong.

**Special Consequence Condition(SCC)**

**Absolute SCC** If H entails K, and H is absolutely confirmed by E, then K is absolutely confirmed given E

This is right, but...

**Incremental SCC** If H entails K, and H is incrementally confirmed by E, then K is incrementally confirmed given E

This is not right because more evidence for a theory does not guarantee the the increase in the prediction
