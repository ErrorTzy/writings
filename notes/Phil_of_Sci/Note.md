Sufficient condition for science:
1. Theories
2. Confirmation/Disconfirmation

On theory:
3. Observational statement(consists of observational vocabulary): The cup is on the table
4. Theoratical statement(consists of theoratical vocabulary): All water boils at 212F

Logical Positivism: Reduce theoratical vocab to observational vocab
Problem: Very hard ==Not impossible!!!==

### On Confirmation:


1st candidate: **Hypothesis-Deduction Confirmation(HD method)**:
Given hypothesis, try derive observation. Now check whether we can observe such thing. If we sees the obseration, it confirms hypothesis.

to do this, for a hypothesis(electron has mass), we still need initial condition (e.g. this is an electron), auxiliary hypothesis(whatever has mass has weight on earth) to derive an observable sentence.

Problem: 
confirmation cannot be achieved by deduction; 
disconfirmation can only say that, at least one of the hypothesis is false 

incremental confirmation vs. absolute confirmation

**Qualitative Confirmation**: it does not tell you *how much* the hypothesis is confirmed.

--> Special case of HD method: 
**Nicod's criterion** All F that's G confirms (at least a bit) that "All Fs are Gs"

**Equivalence Condition**: If H and K are logically equivalent, then anything confirms H also confirms K

Also, we know that ""All Fs are Gs" is equivalent to "All non-Gs are non-Fs "

**Hempel's Ravens Paradox**: Consider the hypothesis "All ravens are black." We have "All things that are not black are not ravens." According to Nicod's criterion, a white shirt confirms "All ravens are black."

Answer: A white shirt does confirms it in that it rules out a possibility to falsify the hypothesis.

Tentative: confirmation depends on how much samples have you tested

Problem: We are very certain that cooper is conducted, but how many copper have we tested in the universe?

Hempel's solution: accept the conclusion in only some occasion.

Confirmation only occurs when hypothesis hold up to *epistemic risk.* A white shirt is not an evidence in the context where the hypothesis is not a risk; But if you don't know it is a shirt and it flew over you and you thought it might be a raven, then it would threat the hypothesis that "all ravens are black". In this case, since the hypothesis is at risk, this count as a evidence.

All humans are under 11 feet tall
You see a human that is 10.999 feet tall
This is a positive instance, but you seems less confident, that's because we have some background knowledge about our chance of meeting a 10.999 ft tall is almost the same as 11 ft
