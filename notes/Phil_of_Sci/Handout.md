# The Conjunction Objection

## Gist

**Objection 1**:

- (P0) Science puts theories together.
- (P1) Putting theories together means accepting the conjunction of theories.
- (P2) Anti-realists cannot accept the conjunction of theories.
- (C) Therefore, anti-realists are wrong.

**Reply**: (P1) is false.

- **Positive Defense**: Putting theories together means correcting theories, not conjoining theories.
- **Negative Defense**: Scientists are not necessarily confident about the empirical adequacy of the conjunction.

**Objection 2**:

- (P0) Science aims at a unified theory.
- (P1) Anti-realists are happy with disparate mini-theories.
- (C) Therefore, anti-realists are wrong.

**Reply**: (P1) is false. Empirical adequacy requires the unification of mini-theories into larger ones

## Objection 1: Details

**Defense for P2**: Let A, C be observable phenomena, and let $\alpha$ be an unobservable process.

- **Theory 1:**
    1. If A is observed, then there is $\alpha$.
    2. C will be observed if and only if there is $\alpha$.
- **Theory 2:**
    1. If A is observed, then there is no $\alpha$.
    2. C will be observed if and only if there is no $\alpha$.

Assume that we observe C whenever we observe A. Then, Theory 1 and Theory 2 are both empirically adequate, but their conjunction yields a contradiction:

1. A is observed.
2. There is $\alpha$ (from 1.1).
3. C will be observed (from 1.2 and 2).
4. C will not be observed (from 2.2 and 2).

For realists, this problem does not arise because Theory 1 and Theory 2 cannot both be true. If two theories are both true, then, by logic, their conjunction must also be true.

*Since consistency is the minimal requirement for theory acceptance, why can't we stipulate that we cannot conjoin two inconsistent theories?*

**Objection to P1**: Let A and B be two accepted theories. Let Theory AB be the conjunction of A and B.

1. If (P1) is true, then we are warranted in accepting AB.
2. If we are warranted in accepting AB, then we are warranted in believing that AB is empirically adequate.
3. If we do not have observational support for the empirical adequacy of AB, then we are not warranted in believing that AB is empirically adequate.
4. We do not have observational support for the empirical adequacy of AB when we first conjoin A and B.

Since (P1) and 1,2,3,4 form an inconsistent set, and since 1,2,3,4 seem plausible, (P1) must be false.

*Is there room to argue against (3)? For example, the empirical adequacy of A and B might provide some reason to believe in the empirical adequacy of AB.*

## Objection 2: Details

**Alternative Reply (Pierre Duhem)**: (P0) is false.

- **Objection**: This seems crazy. Moreover, it would be impractical if we were unable to use two theories together to address complex situations.

**Objection to P1**: Let A be a theory of physiology and B be a theory of electrostatics. Let S be a situation that requires applying both physiology and electrostatics.

1. If (P1) is true, then anti-realists should be satisfied with dealing with S using disparate mini-theories.
2. Dealing with S using disparate mini-theories forces us to say either (i) S is impossible, or (ii) we need a new theory for S.
3. Anti-realists are unwilling to accept either of these options.
4. Therefore, (P1) is false.

*What is wrong with a new theory for S? In cases of extreme complexity, we do develop new theories. The truth of (P1) does not mean we can never use two theories together. There may be pragmatic reasons to use conjunctive theories sometimes. Therefore I feel unclear how exactly the aim of empirical adequacy already requires the successive unification of mini-theories into larger ones.*

# Pragmatic Virtues and Explanation

## Gist

**4.1 and 4.2**: There is a distinction between  

1. Syntactic virtues: consistency, completeness, etc.  
2. Semantic virtues: primarily truth and empirical adequacy.  
3. Pragmatic virtues: explanatory power (partly), elegance, simplicity, etc.  

**Objection (4.3)**:  

- (P0) Scientists pursue better theories even when the existing ones are empirically adequate.  
- (P1) If the aim of science is empirical adequacy, then scientists have no reason to pursue further once a theory is empirically adequate.  
- (P2) Scientists are pursuing the aim of science.  
- (C) The aim of science is not empirical adequacy.  

**Reply**: (P1) is false because  

1. People can always question whether a theory that appears empirically adequate is truly empirically adequate.  
2. There are other pragmatic reasons to pursue further developments.  

*Is this sufficient to explain why scientists continue their pursuit?*  

## More about 4.2

**Parallel between language and scientific theory**: Natural language has three levels:  

1. Syntax: the intrinsic properties of the language itself.  
2. Semantics: the relationship between language and the world.  
3. Pragmatics: the relationship between language and its speakers.  

Similarly, we can analyze a theory on three levels:  

1. Internal properties: consistency, completeness, etc.  
2. Semantic properties: its relation to the world, primarily truth and empirical adequacy.  
3. Pragmatic properties: the explanatory power of a theory and how we use theories to explain.  

Language emerges from our need to communicate. Semantics is an abstraction from communicative practice (though indexicality shows that this abstraction cannot always be fully achieved).  

Science emerges from our need to explain. Theories are abstractions from explanatory practice. However, the aim of science is not merely explanation but truth (or empirical adequacy).  

*This move suggests that science is not just about contextually appropriate explanations. Beyond the need for explanation, there is also an essential need for truth (or empirical adequacy) driving science.* 

## More about 4.3

**Proposition**: Explanation is not an overriding virtue. 

- **Explanation does not override syntactic virtues**: A theory cannot allow any part of it to be inconsistent, though it can leave some part unexplained.  
- **Explanation does not override semantic virtues**: We do not consider something an explanation unless it is based on an acceptable theory.  
- **Explanation does not override other pragmatic virtues**: Hidden variables in quantum mechanics explain the brute fact of correlation, yet they are not widely accepted.
