Assume we have a person P who was born at $t_0$. Assume P has a fully functioning consciousness and memory system from $t_0$. P was flogged at $t_a$, took standard at $t_b$ and became a general at $t_c$ ($a,b,c \in N, c>b>a>0$). $P_x$ is a shorthand for P at $t_x$. 

1. $P_b$ can remember everything in $[t_0,t_b]$. 
2. $P_c$ can remember everything in $[t_b,t_c]$, i.e. he forgot he was flogged at $t_a$.

Now, Reid's argument goes that,

3. $P_{a}=P_{b},$ because $P_b$ can extend his consciousness to $P_a$
4. $P_{b}=P_{c},$ because $P_c$ can extend his consciousness to $P_b$
5. $P_{a} \neq P_{c},$ because $P_c$ cannot extend his consciousness to $P_a$
6. $P_{a} = P_{c},$ because (3) and (4)

Then there is a contradiction between 5 and 6, and it seems that it doesn't make any sense to deny 6. Thus there exists at least one false proposition in (3),(4),(5). In any case, Locke's definition of identity is wrong.

I want to modify Locke's theory to (7),(8),(9),(10) and therefore deny (4).

But first I want to clarify an ambiguity here. When we say $P_{a}=P_{b},$ it seems misleading because it is as if saying that there is an *object* at $t_a$ and another *object* at $t_b$ and they are one and the same thing. But this is not true. P at $t_a$ is not an object but a *$t_a$-aspect* of object P [^1]. 

This is because we can talk about someone in the past. When we say "this man was my friend" we point to an aspect of a person at $t_a$ to refer to a person that persists throughout time. If we are only referring to an aspect of this person, we cannot use the past tense. Therefore strictly speaking, the notation in (3), for example, should be $O_{P_{a}}=O_{P_{b}},$ meaning that the object O that we refer to by pointing to $P_a$ is the object O that we refer to by pointing to $P_b$. 

Then we can construct P (the person object) in the following way. First we define a function $M(x) \rightarrow y$. This means that, a $t_x$-aspect is having some mental activity A, and is mapped to $t_{x+1}$-aspect. The mapping relationship exists only when potential memories belong to $t_x$-aspect also belong to $t_{x+1}$-aspect, and $t_{x+1}$-aspect has the potential memory of A.

7. P is a set of *aspects*.
8. $P_{0}\in P$
9. For any $x \in P, M(x)$ is also a member of P

If we construct P in this way, we can see that (3) is true, because $P_{a},P_{b} \in P$. However, since $P_c$ forgot being flogged at $t_a$, it is easy to prove that $P_{c} \notin P$. Therefore 4 is denied. 

That is to say, to see if two aspect refers to the same person, we just need to see if there is a set, i.e. a person object, that they both belong to.

Then you may ask, what object are we referring to when we point to $P_c$? We can construct a $P'$ by replacing $P_0$ in (8) with $P_b$. This may bring a problem that there are too many P primes that can be constructed: actually we can replace $P_0$ in (8) with any number we like and construct another P prime. But this can be avoided by adding another rule (for simplicity, I will describe this in natural language to avoid using too many symbols):

10. There is a set S of constructed $P$ set such that, any no member is a subset of another member. Only members in S are valid $P$ sets.

This will exclude the cases where you can still construct P primes when there's nothing wrong with P's potential memory. And if you lose memory, you will become a new person the moment you lose memory, and that moment will become the new "initial member(i.e., $P_{0}$ in 8)" of the new person.

This keeps a Lockean flavor because:

- Personal identity is still defined by potential memory, and
- M is a function that is similar to Locke's "consciousness extends through time"


[^1]: I don't know if my "aspect" is the same as "stage" or "sub-person". But it seems that it's not stage because I am not treating persons as events. Or maybe you can say an aspect of an object is still an object. Anyway I want to distinguish between "aspect of person" and "person". A person is something that persists throughout time, so when we say P at ta, it is not a complete person. To use an analogy, a die has 6 aspects(i.e. sides). Assume we can only see one face of the die at any moment. As time passes, the die 'rolls' to show a new face in numerical order. Then t0-aspect displays 1, t1-aspect displays 2, etc.. Similarly, a person object is like a ball 'rolls' to show aspects in time.
