# Introduction

identity holds over times: personal identity?

Body I Info II
Body II Info I

Two senses of identity

Numerical Identity vs. Qualitative Identity
- Numerical Identity: there is only one thing. Two things with exactly same property cannot be identical
- Qualitative Identity: Two things have the same property

`Continuious change over time would be hard to define`

Leibniz law
- The principle of the indiscernability of identicals/The principle of substituibility of identicals
- The identity of indiscerniables (converse of II, unless you bring space and time in)

`How to reconcile the leibniz law and the commonsensical understanding of identity?`

I have all the properties over time `Future contingent issue?`

> How to reconcile identity over time and Leibniz's law? For example: there was me in the kindergarten and have property P, and there is me now that does not have property P. For convenience, let's call me in the kindergarten me at t0, and me now at t1.

> Solution A:
> There are two propositions:
> 1. I have P at t0
> 2. I don't have P at t1
> And you can see that 1 and 2 are both true for me. Therefore, I am identical with the me in the kindergarten. This reconciles

> Remark:
> Assume we are at t0. What is the truth value of the proposition "'I don't have P at t1' is true at t0"?
> 1. If it is true already at t0: then I am destined to not have P at t1.
> 2. If it is undetermined/false at t0: but it is also true at t1 that "I don't have P at t1 is true at t1". But if it is true at t1, then according to Leibniz's law it is also true at t0. Then it follows that even if it is undetermined at t0, it is inevitable that I don't have P at t1 anyway.
> But for I don't have P at t1 has already been a fact, it is pretty much presupposed that it is determined because we are arguing this at t1. So we may need a better word for "determined"

> This way of thinking about properties means that properties belongs to objects and some time.
> One simple way to get out of this is to deny that all objects are logical constructions and there is no metaphysical object. Only after something happened could there be some object constructed as being identical with itself.

> One main problem is to resolve what does it mean by "it is actual that P at t1" at t0.
>
> It is only a metaphysical construction?
P1-12, Locke

# Locke's theory

Four kinds of continuity

1. Casual continuity
2. Compositional continuity
3. Spacial-temporal continuity
4. Qualitative continuity

Identity over time is basically there's some continuity here. But if continuity is not enough, then what is missing?

Continuity with respect to a kind/sortal

Consider:

1. A red car is painted yellow, and
2. A red car is crushed

The continuity of 1 still holds while 2 does not. This is because 

> Can there be a functional view of identity?


Monday: tree has trunk and branch
Tuesday: tree has only trunk
Explanation: tree â‰  trunk on Tuesday. Tree stage is equal to trunk stage at Tuesday but the tree is not the trunk altogether.

Perry's interpretation: later stages can contain earlier stages

For Locke:
1. Memory
2. Body
3. Mass
4. Spirit/Soul/Substance

(P) Memory of memory then memory

Refutation: we need potential memory

Read next: Butler

Non-substance view: it is not a priori that there is substance. We can just use "object"

Mereological essentialism: A thing cannot change its parts

Consider the position: there is no true identity of this tree and another tree, strictly speaking

Eli: 
1. there exists shmenglish such that can speak the identity of two tree
2. according to principle of interpretative charity, English is shmenglish.

Interpretative charity: if someone says "dog", you should not think he's thinking about 'cat' but there's some problem with his mind

Speaking loosely: exaggeration; if someone challenges you you pull back.

> Reidentifying objects seems to require first person pronouns
>
> First person pronouns fixes "here". When I look at something, turns around, and look back, I need to use "here", and thus first person pronoun.
