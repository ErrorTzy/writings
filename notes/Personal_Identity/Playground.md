"Survival" is a misleading word, at least to me, because it indicates a negative tone. I hardly see anything valuable in someone merely surviving. On the contrary, it just sounds pathetic. It is also an extremely obscure word. No one who is living now can tell us what is death. And if we don't know what is death, how are we going to define survival?

Parfit did not say that we cannot have de se belief!

(GPTed)On forming false belief
Our minds create beliefs that serve us well in everyday life, but these beliefs do not always guarantee truth in every situation. For example, our taste buds warn us that something may be bad for us by registering an unpleasant bitterness. This made perfect sense in nature, where bitter plants were often poisonous. As a result, we may have developed a belief that bitter things are bad for us.

However, many medicines that can heal us also taste bitter. If we taste something bitter and there is no doctor around, we might instinctively assume that the suspicious liquid is poisonousâ€”though it could, in fact, be the medicine that could cure our disease.

In other words, it is very normal for us to form beliefs that are not grounded by facts. Then it is possible form de se belief for PF language users, and it is psychologically plausible if PF language users are living in our society where we usually don't have fission or fusion.

One thing off with Williams' thought experiment is to test personal identity with fear ==expand==. But I am afraid of being punished in the future does not entail that I am the future person, just like I believe the medicine is poisonous does not entail that this medicine is actually poisonous.

But there is room for Williams to argue that, there is no metaphysical personal identity. There's only psychological personal identity. But our psychology is complicated. For example ==denying the past self when bad, confirming the past self when good==. And we may have a personal identity for psychopath ==example==, etc. This would lead to a pluralism of personal identity. A metaphysical account, instead of a merely psychological one can serve as a judicial theory, in case someone denies responsibility.


Parfit's claim is about metaphysics. Of course we can form true belief or false belief based on our psychology pattern. What Parfit argues is that our psychology is just a
