> Prompt: Parfit’s idea that it is philosophically worthwhile to alter the ordinary language of personal identity.

## Intro

In *Personal Identity*, Parfit argues that "If the psychological continuity took a branching form, we ought to speak in a new way." In this paper, I analyze how his departure from ordinary language could be justified. Then I try to defend Parfit from Hirsch's objection. I close the paper by mentioning the issue of first-person pronouns a little bit.

### Clarification of terms

First, let me clarify some terms used in this paper.

Two people, A and B, are *psychologically continuous* if there is a continuous psychological process from A (the starting point) to B (the end point). This is a transitive relationship. In other words, if A is psychologically continuous with B, and B is psychologically continuous with C, then A is also psychologically continuous with C. This works because if there’s a continuous process from A to B, and another continuous process from B to C, the two processes together form a continuous process from A to C.

On the other hand, A and B are *psychologically connected* if there are some direct psychological links between them. These links could include things like intentions, memories, or other mental connections (e.g., q-intention or q-remember). Unlike continuity, connectedness is not transitive. If A is psychologically connected to B, and B is connected to C, it doesn’t necessarily mean that A and C are connected. For example, suppose B remembers being A, and C remembers being B. But C may forget being A. If we simplify the psychological connections to only q-remembering, A and C are not psychologically connected.

According to Parfit, A and B are one person if they are *psychological continuous*, and this psychological continuity must take an *one-to-one form*. "One-to-one form" means that, there does not exist some person other than A that is also continuous to B, and there does not exist someone person other than B that is also continuous to A.

## Parfit's departure

Parfit’s first deviation from ordinary language is not the creation of q-words, but his use of the word "survive". He doesn’t explicitly state that this is a break from everyday language, but rather a break from “the language of identity.” However, I find it hard to believe that any ordinary person would think the statement “I will survive, but I will no longer exist” is not self-contradictory. To me, this clearly marks a departure from ordinary language. Therefore I start with Parfit's use of "survival"

In our world, people do not split or merge. Because of this, "survive" always picks out one-to-one relationships. However, it’s unclear whether the meaning of "survive" entails a one-to-one constraint. But now we must know how to use the word "survive" in the face of fission and fusion. Then it would lead to three ways we might interpret "survive":

1. **Restrictive use**: "Survive" applies only to normal, one-to-one cases. Whether the one-to-one constraint is part of its meaning doesn’t matter. For cases involving fission or fusion, we would coin a new term. Accordingly, "someone survives after fusion/fission" is syntactically ill-formed.
2. **Include constraint**: The meaning of "survive" carries the one-to-one constraint. Accordingly "someone survives after fusion/fission" is false.
3. **Exclude constraint**: The meaning of "survive" does not carry the one-to-one constraint. Accordingly, "someone survives after fusion/fission" is true.

When Parfit introduces q-words, it is not directly clear which of these approaches he adopted. I will return to this point later. Anyway, for the word "survive," it is clear that he chooses the third approach. How did he justify this choice?

### The second approach

Parfit spent considerable time refuting the second approach, so let’s examine it first. As I’ve argued, saying "I will survive, but I will no longer exist" seems outright self-contradictory to ordinary people. Thus the advantage of the second approach is that, it respects ordinary view that survival implies personal identity.

The problem with this approach arises when we consider this. If a person can survive with one hemisphere destroyed and the other preserved, then how could they not survive when both hemispheres are preserved?

But why not simply accept this position and insist that we speak this way? After all, just as "XYZ on Twin Earth is not water" initially seems counterintuitive but remains plausible upon reflection, the claim that we do not survive when both hemispheres are preserved may also seem counterintuitive at first glance but still plausible, due to the semantics of "survive."

Parfit responds to this objection, but his reply feels unsatisfying.[^1] He appeals to Williams' principle, which states: "An important judgment should be asserted or denied only on importantly different grounds." According to this principle, if we assert that a person survives as one individual based on psychological continuity, we must also assert that they survive as two individuals in fission cases. Otherwise, we violate the principle.

This response is unsatisfying. Those who insist on the second approach never accept that psychological continuity alone is a sufficient ground. The one-to-one relationship would also be a necessary ground. Since they hold that both grounds matter, Parfit’s argument collapses.

Parfit must then argue that the one-to-one relationship is not important. However, this claim is a conclusion arises only after adopting the third approach. Using a conclusion to justify its own premise would be circular. Thus, in the paper *Personal Identity*, Parfit fails to provide a satisfying explanation for his proposal to "abandon the language of identity".

However, Parfit’s position can still be defended, though not for the reasons he gives. Consider this scenario: You have cancer and go to the hospital. The doctor tells you there is a newly developed treatment, but then adds, "You are not going to survive this." If we define “survival” according to the second approach, the doctor’s words would become confusing. You would immediately ask for clarification: “Do you mean this treatment will fail, and I will die? Or do you mean it might cause me to split or fuse?” The second approach makes the semantics of “survive” unnecessarily ambiguous, which complicates communication.

Now, one might argue that adopting the third approach also leaves room for people who care deeply about splitting or merging to ask follow-up questions, like "What do you mean by survive? Will I split or merge?" However, this concern seems less pressing. It would be plausible to assume that more people are worried about not surviving than about splitting or fusing. Because of this, it seems plausible to assume that fewer people would ask for clarification under the third approach. Therefore, the third approach ensures relatively more effective communication.

This justification for adopting the third approach is not circular. It does not appeal to the "unimportance of one-to-one relationship." Instead, it appeals to two assumptions:

1. Our language should be as efficient as possible for communication, and
2. Fewer people ask for clarification under the third approach. 

Of course here we are not talking about the efficiency of communication in an ordinary context[^2]. The whole discussion about fission and fusion makes no sense to ordinary people, since we almost never split or merge. It would be a total waste of efficiency for ordinary people to read all these discussions. When we talk about semantics that is consistent with fission and fusion, we place ourselves in a philosophical context where it is normal for people to merge or split. And we are talking about how would we speak in this context. Within this context, the third approach is more efficient than the second one, based on the second assumption.

### The First Approach

Parfit never mentioned the first approach in his paper. But the first approach seems to completely eliminate the ambiguity and seems more efficient. There may be a problem with this approach, though. Assume we coin the word "vurvise" and your doctor says, "You are going to vurvise after this operation." You understand that "vurvise" means you will split or merge, but you might still feel unsure whether to accept the operation (assuming that ordinary people do feel unsure.)

Yet this doesn’t seem like a genuine problem. Consider a scenario where you grew up in a community where splitting and merging happen regularly. It may be difficult for us to imagine such a life, but in that context, people would naturally develop a clear understanding of what "vurvise" means, and what emotion it would imply. They would also know how to evaluate whether an operation leading to vurvisal is acceptable. So, if your doctor says, "You are going to vurvise after this operation," you would have no trouble deciding whether to proceed or not.

How, then, can we justify Parfit's choice? I believe the key is to identity the context that Parfit put himself in. When we discussed communication efficiency earlier, we noted that the third approach is better than the second in the philosophical context. But what is this "philosophical context," exactly? If the context is our actual world—where splitting and merging do not occur—there is no need to alter our language at all. Now if the context is a world where fission and fusion are normal (let's call this world "F-world"), the first approach is clearly the most efficient. People would naturally adapt their language to include terms like "vurvise" to describe survival after fission or fusion.

Parfit, however, seems to place himself in a context that lies between these two extremes. Imagine a transition scenario where splitting and merging are not yet possible but soon will be. In this context, the first approach—though it eliminates ambiguity—does not help us understand what "vurvisal" means. But there is a connection between "survival" and "vurvisal," i.e. they all entail psychological continuity. Here, Parfit’s preference for the third approach helps us understand more about fission and fusion. Even if people in F-world eventually develop "vurvise" and understand it differently from Parfit’s "survival," extending the existing semantics of "survive" offers heuristics for non-F-worlders. In other words, in order to justify Parfit's choice, we need to add the following principle:

3. When encountering a new but related concept, we are better served by extending the meaning of an existing word than to coin a new one.

When we are discussing philosophical problems pertaining to fusion and fission, we are putting ourselves in a context that is somewhere between the ordinary world and the F-world. We are dealing with words that do not make sense in ordinary contexts. Ordinary people would just say, "Why would anyone care about all these stupid questions, since we never split or merge?" But we also cannot talk about these words like the F-worlders do. Therefore, we must imagine we are in this intermediate context in order to make sense of what we are doing. It follows that Parfit's departure from ordinary "survival" seems to be a good choice if we accept these principles and presumptions.

### Q-words

Parfit then introduces what he calls "q-words." At first glance, his treatment of the word "survive" seems different, because he did not coin a term like "q-survive." However, upon closer inspection, there is no significant difference between his modification of "survive" and his introduction of q-words. Therefore the introduction of q-words is also justified in the same way "survival" is justified.

Take the example of "q-memory." Parfit argues that "it may be a logical truth that we can only remember our own experiences." To address this, he coins the term "q-memory," removing this logical restriction. He then suggests that we "drop the concept of memory and use in its place the wider concept of q-memory." But what is the real difference between this process and simply extending the meaning of "memory" while excluding its usual one-to-one constraint? The only clear difference is that Parfit adds the prefix "q-" to the word "memory."

Why, then, does Parfit bother to add the "q-" prefix at all? He justifies this step by claiming that "it may be a logical truth that we can only remember our own experiences." But I believe a similar logical truth applies to the concept of survival in ordinary language—namely, that survival entails identity. Perhaps Parfit does not share this intuition and, as a result, feels no need to add a "q-" prefix to "survive." Yet, aside from this cosmetic difference, the two altering processes are essentially the same.

Therefore, the justification Parfit provides for extending the meaning of "survive" without a one-to-one constraint applies equally to his q-words. 

One may argue that the introduction of q-words undermines the third principle. But q-words are not entirely new terms (like "vurvise") but merely variations of existing words with the one-to-one constraint removed. If Parfit were fully consistent with his treatment of "survive," he could have simply dropped the "q-" prefix from all q-words. The prefix "q-" functions more like a helpful reminder. We should understand the semantics of these q-words the same as the original words, except we should not assume they entail a first-person subject. In this way, q-words are not truly new words. The third principle is not violated.

What's special about q-words is probably that they are psychological connections. We are more sensitive to the change of meaning in mental words. This leads to some objections.

## Hirsch's Objection

Hirsch posed two objections to the q-words. The first focuses on q-memory. Hirsch says that, 

> According to Shoemaker, when one remembers having had a past experience, all that one knows non-inferentially is that the experience occurred and is the cause of one’s present memory. That it was oneself that had the experience requires an inference (“Since I remember the experience, it must be that I had it.”). q-memory is simply memory minus that inference. 

Hirsch he challenges whether the q-memory content of a negative state can be coherent at all, such as “not having had a headache a moment ago.” Since q-memory excludes the inference of a subject, it seems the only way to interpret the content of such a q-memory is as “there was no headache anywhere in the universe.” But this interpretation is clearly absurd.[^3]

However, why q-memory cannot have an inference of the subject? Parfit only prohibits the attribution of q-memory to *me*, but he does not prohibit the attribution of q-memory to an *antecedent self*.

An A is the *antecedent/descendant self* of B if A and B are psychologically continuous. A is B's *future/past self* if A and B are psychologically connected. Parfit suggests that we use "I" to denote only future/past selves, but not antecedent/descendant selves. Assume there is a world where people do not merge or split but have ever-lasting bodies. Now A and B are not psychologically connected. But A and B have one-to-one psychological continuity. In this case, A and B have personal identity, but A cannot use "I" to denote B, and vice versa. Since q-memory entails an “M-relation” between the q-rememberer and the subject of the past experience, it is possible to constrain the subject of the past experience to antecedent selves. Therefore it is coherent to say that q-memory can be attributed to an antecedent self but not to me. 

I believe the difference between memory and q-memory does not lie in their content, but _in the domain of discourse_ of the quantifier in the inference. The content of the negative state mentioned above is always “there does not exist headache a moment ago,” no matter if it is memory or q-memory. In ordinary memory, the domain of inference is limited to the self (e.g., “_I_ was not having a headache”). In q-memory, the domain is broader and includes other antecedent selves (e.g., “No antecedent self was having a headache”).

Hirsch’s second objection targets q-intention. He argues that if Rebecca splits into Reb and Ecca, it becomes impossible to specify what Reb or Ecca should do in the future. I agree with Hirsch on this point, but I do not see it as a problem. It is just the limitation of q-intention. Rebecca can only q-intend "I shall roam the world" and causes both Reb and Ecca to roam the world. But Rebecca cannot specify "Reb shall roam the world."

## First Person Pronoun

Hirsch also argues that, (assuming Rebecca is a Parfit's language speaker,) Rebecca cannot have de se beliefs. Therefore, she cannot even form the intention "I shall roam the world" in a de se way and cause Reb and Ecca to roam the world.

But I do not find it fully convincing. I am exceeding the word limit, so I cannot argue in detail here. This requires a separate discussion.

I wish to argue that Rebecca should be able to form de se belief. Parfit never abandoned the first-person pronoun[^4]. He just restricts the use of it. Assume there is a twin earth Rebecca that speaks normal English. The mental state of Rebecca and twin-earth-Rebecca should make no difference when they both say 'I'.



[^1]: Parfit also has another more obvious objection in the paper. He claims that it is absurd to say someone dies after the split operation. But this objection clearly would not work. Those who take the second approach would not say they die. According to their way of speaking, "die" would carry a "one-to-zero" constraint. Therefore they just do not survive. And it is not absurd to say that a split person does not survive, given their definition of survive.
[^2]: The term "ordinary context" might be a bit obscure. It might be defined as a set of usual contexts where ordinary people communicate with each other.
[^3]: Hirsch himself gives a counterargument to his own objection. As long as episodic memory cannot be negative, his objection would fail. I agree with this counterargument, since the logical structure of a negative thought is rather abstract, while our episodic memories should consist of concrete particulars. 
[^4]: In the paper *Personal Identity*, at least. I don't know whether he changed his mind later. All the conclusions here draw solely from the paper *Personal Identity.*
