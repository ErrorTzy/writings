Prompt: Parfit’s idea that it is philosophically worthwhile to alter the ordinary language of personal identity.

1. How did Parfit alter the ordinary language

In *Personal Identity*, Parfit argues that "If the psychological continuity took a branching form, we ought to speak in a new way."

First, let me clarify the terms psychological continuity and psychological connectedness.

Two people, A and B, are *psychologically continuous* if there is a continuous psychological process from A (the starting point) to B (the end point). This is a transitive relationship. In other words, if A is psychologically continuous with B, and B is psychologically continuous with C, then A is also psychologically continuous with C. This works because if there’s a continuous process from A to B, and another continuous process from B to C, the two processes together form continuous process from A to C.

On the other hand, A and B are *psychologically connected* if there are some direct psychological links between them. These links could include things like intentions, memories, or other mental connections (e.g., q-intention or q-remember). Unlike continuity, connectedness is not transitive. If A is psychologically connected to B, and B is connected to C, it doesn’t necessarily mean that A and C are connected. For example, suppose B remembers being A, and C remembers being B. But C may forget being A. If we simply all the psychological connections to only q-remembering, A and C are not psychologically connected.



What way?


"Survival" is a misleading word, at least to me, because it indicates a negative tone. I hardly see anything valuable in someone merely surviving. On the contrary, it just sounds pathetic. It is also an extremely obscure word. No one who is living now can tell us what is death. And if we don't know what is death, how are we going to define survival?

Parfit did not say that we cannot have de se belief!

(GPTed)On forming false belief
Our minds create beliefs that serve us well in everyday life, but these beliefs do not always guarantee truth in every situation. For example, our taste buds warn us that something may be bad for us by registering an unpleasant bitterness. This made perfect sense in nature, where bitter plants were often poisonous. As a result, we may have developed a belief that bitter things are bad for us.

However, many medicines that can heal us also taste bitter. If we taste something bitter and there is no doctor around, we might instinctively assume that the suspicious liquid is poisonous—though it could, in fact, be the medicine that could cure our disease.

In other words, it is very normal for us to form beliefs that are not grounded by facts. Then it is possible form de se belief for PF language users, and it is psychologically plausible if PF language users are living in our society where we usually don't have fission or fusion.

One thing off with Williams' thought experiment is to test personal identity with fear ==expand==. But I am afraid of being punished in the future does not entail that I am the future person, just like I believe the medicine is poisonous does not entail that this medicine is actually poisonous.

But there is room for Williams to argue that, there is no metaphysical personal identity. There's only psychological personal identity. But our psychology is complicated. For example ==denying the past self when bad, confirming the past self when good==. And we may have a personal identity for psychopath ==example==, etc. This would lead to a pluralism of personal identity. A metaphysical account, instead of a merely psychological one can serve as a judicial theory, in case someone denies responsibility.

**On survival:**

Parfit’s first deviation from ordinary language is not the creation of q-words, but his use of the word "survive". He doesn’t explicitly state that this is a break from everyday language, but rather a break from “the language of identity.” However, I find it hard to believe that any ordinary person would think the statement “I will survive, but I will no longer exist” is not self-contradictory. To me, this clearly marks a departure from ordinary language.

**How did Parfit justify this departure?**

Personal identity is a one-to-one relationship.

In our world, people do not split or merge--at least for now. Because of this, the concept of "survive" always picks out one-to-one relationships. However, it’s unclear whether the meaning of "survive" entails a one-to-one constraint. Picking out one-to-one relationships may as well be contingent, given that splitting and merging don’t happen in our world.

But now we must now how to use the word "survive" in the face of fission and fusion. Then it would lead to three ways we might interpret "survive":

1. **Restrictive use**: "Survive" applies only to normal, one-to-one cases. Whether the one-to-one constraint is part of its meaning doesn’t matter. For cases involving fission or fusion, we would coin a new term. Accordingly, "someone survives after fusion/fission" is syntactically ill-formed.
2. **Extended use with constraint**: "Survive" can be extended to fission and fusion cases but still carries the one-to-one constraint. Accordingly "someone survives after fusion/fission" is false.
3. **Extended use without constraint**: "Survive" can be extended to fission and fusion cases, and the one-to-one constraint no longer applies in all cases. Accordingly, "someone survives after fusion/fission" is true.

When Parfit coins q-words, he seems to take the second strategy. But Parfit did not coin "q-survive." Instead, Parfit adopted the third one.



? Parfit takes the former view as "the language of identity," and argue that we should abandon this language and use the latter one.

The logical space:
Normal cases where one-to-one, abnormal cases where one-to-many or many-to-one
we use the word survive to mean one-to-one cases in ordinary language.
1. Coin a new word "q-survive" for abnormal cases. Do not care about intention or extention
	1. But should we care about this word and bring the desire to survive to the case we may q-survive?
2. Extend the word survival to the abnormal cases:
	1. Include the one-to-one constraint: do not survive after split or fusion
		1. Problem: if you can survive with one hemisphere being destroyed and one hemisphere being preserved, how could you not survive with two hemispheres being preserved?
			1. But what's the problem if I insist to define words in this way? Just like "XYZ on the twin earth is not water" seems counterintuitive at first glance, not surviving with two hemisphere may be a bit counterintuitive but still plausible, considering how we define "survive"
				1. Parfit's response: this violates the principle: "an important judgment should be asserted or denied only on importantly different grounds." Since we assert we survive as one man on grounds of psychological continuity, we should also assert we survive as two, or we will disobey the principle.
					1. I never commit to the view that psychological continuity is a sufficient ground for personal identity. This cannot be the reason.
				2. What I believe to be the real reason: it would confuse you in terms of decision and action, as long as you don't have the intuition that when you multiplies you die. And I believe most people do not feel this way. If this is true, then in normal cases we would be motivated to take action to prevent us from dying, but less motivated to prevent us from splitting or fusing. For example, you had cancer and went to the hospital. The doctor tells you that there is a newly developed treatment, but you are not going to survive this. If you adopt the semantics of "survive" as, then will definitely as the doctor what do you mean. Do you mean that this treatment does not fit me and I will die after it, or it may cause me to split or fuse?
	2. Exclude the one-to-one constraint: survive after split or fusion. This is Parfit's postion.

Parfit keeps talking about "what matters is the psychological continuity." What does "matter" even mean?





Parfit's claim is about metaphysics. Of course we can form true belief or false belief based on our psychology pattern. What parfit argues is that our psychology is just a
