Personal Identity Midterm Questions

# Q1

>  **Explain why the following is true: Leibniz’s Law requires Locke to deny the intuitive principle “Two things cannot occupy exactly the same place at the same time.”   On the other hand, this principle can be held by mereological essentialists like Butler and Reid.**

Consider one tree over two time periods: 

- At time $t_1$: The tree has one branch 
- Between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$: The branch was chopped off
- At time $t_2$: The tree has no branch

Assume the only change that took place to the tree between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ is the removal of the branch. Let's define "trook" as the mass that the tree has apart from the branch (trunk, roots, etc.). Let $Trook_{1}$ be a shorthand for the trook at $t_{1}$, and $Tree_{1}$ for the tree at $t_{1}$, etc.

Consider these statements:

1. $Tree_{1} \neq Trook_{1}$

because $Trook_{1}$ does not have a branch, while $Tree_{1}$ has. Since they have different properties, according to Leibniz law they are not the same thing.

2. $Tree_{2} = Trook_{2}$

because $Tree_{2}$ and $Trook_{2}$ are composed of exactly the same matter.

3. $Tree_{1} = Tree_{2}$

because there is sufficient continuity within the sortal of a tree so that the tree has identity over time.

4. $Trook_{1} = Trook_{2}$

because for the trook, no change has taken place over time.

5. $Tree_{1} = Trook_{1}$

because according to 2,3,4, $Tree_{1}=Tree_{2}=Trook_{2}=Trook_{1}$.

Since 1 and 5 contradicts with each other, there must be at least one line that goes wrong. 1 is true because of the Leibniz law. And since there is no reason to deny the transitivity of identity, the conjunction of 2,3 and 4 would entail 5. Therefore the problem must exist among 2,3,4.

Locke cannot deny 3 because he distinguishes between the identity of vegetables and the identity of mass. The identity of vegetables is determined by life. That is to say, a vegetable continues to be the same plant as long as it "partakes the same life", though it has changed in parts. (We can best understand "the same life" as referring to a certain type of causal continuity.) Even if the branch is chopped off, the tree is still alive. Therefore, the tree is still the same tree due to the continuity of life.

Locke cannot deny 4. 4 is the case where the identity of mass applies. According to Locke, the identity of mass is determined by its parts. As long as one atom is added or removed, it is no longer the same mass. Since from $t_{1}$ to $t_{2}$, the trook has no change in parts, the trook is still the same trook.

Then Locke can only deny 2 and claim that a tree is not a trook even if they are composed of exactly the same matter. At $t_{2}$, they are still two different things, but just happen to have overlapping stage. By claiming this, there would be two things, i.e. tree and trook, occupy exactly the same place at $t_{2}$.

For mereological essentialists like Butler and Reid, they can maintain 2 while denying 3. Since $Tree_{1}$ and $Tree_{2}$ have different parts, then in the "strict philosophical sense" $Tree_{1} \neq Tree_{2}$. By doing so, they don't need to deny the intuitive principle that "two things cannot occupy exactly the same place at the same time."

# Q3

> **In Butler and Reid the “circularity problem” seems simply to be that if you remember an experience, you must remember that it was you who had the experience, so that personal identity is presupposed in memory.  That problem seems not to bother Perry.  Explain why it does not bother him.  Then explain the main problem of circularity that does bother Perry (I mean the problem discussed at length in class), and explain Perry’s resolution of this problem.**

For Butler and Reid, if I remember some past experience, I must also remember it was me who had the experience. If remembering works this way, and we define having a memory of some past experience as remembering some past experience, then we cannot define personal identity in terms of memory. This is because memory already presupposes personal identity.

Perry argues that remembering does not work this way. This is because it is possible that someone remembers some past experience and it was not them who had that experience. For example, Jones might be hypnotized to believe he examined a green cube in the past, when in fact it was Smith who performed this examination. Even though Jones remembers having examined the cube, it was Smith who actually had that experience in the past, not Jones. Since now remembering does not presuppose personal identity, then Butler and Reid's circularity problem automatically disappears.

But another problem immediately arises. We want to avoid calling Jones and Smith as the same person just because Jones can remember Smith's experience. If we are going to say that personal identity is determined by memory, then memory cannot be any kind of remembering. We must first distinguish the right kind of remembering, which excludes the fake ones, like the one that Jones has.

The circularity that bothers Perry is in how we could exclude the fake ones. It seems that we have to add a "witnessing condition": if Jones actually had the experience of examining the green cube, then Jones' remembering examining the green cube would count as a right kind of remembering of that experience. But "Jones" in the antecedent and the "Jones" in the consequent have to be the same person in order to make the exclusion work. Therefore, the witnessing condition we want to add presupposes personal identity.

However, even if you add this witnessing condition, it still will not sufficiently exclude all the wrong kinds of remembering. For example, Jones may have really examined the green cube, got amnesia, hypnotized into believing that he had examined the green cube, and remembered having the green cube examined. This example suggests that if we can find out the right kind of relation between the past experience and the remembering of the past experience, we can do the exclusion without appealing to personal identity in the witnessing condition. That is to say, in the witnessing condition we do not have to presuppose "Jones" in the antecedent and the "Jones" in the consequent are the same person. We just need to find out what is the correct relation between the experience that "Jones" in the antecedent had and the experience that "Jones" in the consequent has. Perry calls this right kind of relation "M-relation".

Does there really exist such a M-relation? Perry merely hypothesized such existence. This hypothesis relies on the analysis that, when we are talking about memory, we are rigidly designating some underlying process that normally explains our remembering. This underlying process may be revealed by scientific discovery, like how we discover that water is $H_{2}O$. (However,
the underlying process does not have to be physical.) Following this analysis, Perry did not specify the M-relation, but he specifies a way to help us find it out: we just need to find out the underlying process that normally explains some person in a body remembers some experience of a past event, and the person *in the same body* witnessed this event. Since normally we are not hypnotized into remembering things, it would be the right kind of underlying process.
