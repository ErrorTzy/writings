## 1. The Plausible Path

### 1.1 The canonical examples

We identity a particular kind of explanation: the common kind of explanatory theory in philosophy is grounding explanation.

### 1.2 A background view about "explanation" and explanation

Lewis: The distinction between *explanatory act* and *explanatory information*. One can perform explanatory act poorly, the the body of information is still explanatory. The task on a theory of explanation should focus on what qualifies as *explanatory information*, not what makes *explanatory act* good or not. By making the distinction, it avoids the risk that, what is explanatory is just a matter of human psychology. 

A requirement for good explanatory act seems to be to produce understanding. However, to understand is just to possess explanatory information. Therefore, this requirement simply says an act fails to convey information.

Hall's critique: 

1. According to Lewis, explanatory info is causal history. But even if I successfully convey the causal history of the first billion years of the window breaking, I am not close to understanding why the window breaks; 
2. Sequestering epistemology and human psychology does not require act/information distinction.

### 1.3 An attractive foil

How does Lewis' argument apply to the Plausible Path? The step that Lewis took: explanatory information is about some *structure*. The project of fundamentality is to extend it not just to causal structure, but also to metaphysical structure. Therefore, the explanatory act is backed by the explanatory information about the metaphysical structure.

Critical issue: should we leave epistemic and psychological considerations out of our account of explanatory information?

## 2. Two case studies

The aim of the case studies A: human psychology not just affect the right way to convey information; it affacts what count as explanatory information.

The aim of the case studies B: why structures that looks metaphysical has a epistemic foundation; Provide precedent for epistemic approach.

### 2.1 Numbers

An appropriate answer to the question "What is 55 times 27" is the decimal representation "1485", not "55 times 27", or "the product of 15 and 99". But the decimal representation is just $1 \times 10^{4}+ 4 \times 10^{3} + 8 \times 10^{2} + 5 \times 10^{1}$. What makes the decimal representation stands out?

The temptation to go metaphysical: it reveals the metaphyscal essence of the number in question. Hall: this is crazy. The obvious answer is that, we were trained from early childhood to use algorithms under decimal representation. Therefore, the decimal representation is distinctly *useful* for us

Lewis can say: $55 \times 27$, $15 \times 99$ or the decimal/heximal/binary representation has the same information; But only decimal conveys the information more effectively.
Hall: Assume this is so, what singles out the decimal representation? There's still need a pragmatic story to tell.So psychology plays a role, one way or another. (Proof by intimidation)
