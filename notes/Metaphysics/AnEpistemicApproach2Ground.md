## 1. The Plausible Path

### 1.1 The canonical examples

We identity a particular kind of explanation: the common kind of explanatory theory in philosophy is grounding explanation.

### 1.2 A background view about "explanation" and explanation

Lewis metaphysical assent of explanation: 

Explanations are (in)famously sensitive to context, like our interests, background knowledge, and so on. Suppose someone is investigating why a forest fire occurred. In that context, answering "Because oxygen is present in the atmosphere" would be inappropriate. In a chemistry class, however, the same question, "Why was there a forest fire?", might be aptly answered by "Because oxygen is present in the atmosphere." In short, whether something counts as an explanation can depend on contingent features of our epistemic situation and human psychology.

The metaphysical approach to grounding explanations makes a critical claim:

{::M} Grounding explanations are explanatory in virtue of the deep structure of reality.

This is the move Ned Hall targets. Why think grounding explanations are explanatory because of some deep structure of reality? Perhaps they are explanatory because of something else, like our epistemic or psychological features. Hall's alternative proposal is:

{::E} Grounding explanations are explanatory in virtue of our epistemic and psychological features.

Why does Hall argue against {::M}?

First, he reconstructs the motivation for {::M}. Then he undermines that motivation by appealing to two examples.

The motivation for {::M} draws on Lewis's distinction between an *explanatory act* and *explanatory information*. An explanation can be inappropriate in a given context while still conveying explanatory information. In the forest-fire case, it is at least plausible that the presence of atmospheric oxygen is a piece of relevant explanatory *information*. The *act* of offering that information, however, may be inappropriate in some contexts.

On the basis of this distinction, Lewis proposes a "metaphysical ascent." On his view, whether an *act of explaining* is well performed depends on epistemic and psychological factors. By contrast, whether something counts as *explanatory information* is independent of those factors and is a matter of metaphysics. More specifically, Lewis holds that explanatory information about an event concerns the causal structure that produces it: the causes, the causes of those causes, and so on.

This ascent can be extended to the metaphysical approach to grounding. Essentially, Lewis suggests that a genuine explanation of x is backed by a structure underlying x; and that structure need not be limited to causal structure. It is natural, then, to bring grounding structure into the picture. The resulting line of thought is:

{::1} A grounding explanation is explanatory because it conveys information about grounding structure.
{::2} The information about grounding structure are about some deep metaphysical structure of reality.

From {::1} and {::2}, {::M} follows. 

Hall wants to undermine {::2}. In other words, he rejects Lewis's "metaphysical ascent." Hall acknowledges the distinction between explanatory acts and explanatory information. But the distinction does not entail that explanatory information is independent of epistemic and psychological factors. On Hall's view, what makes some chunk of information *explanatory information* could still be epistemic and psychological, without appeal to metaphysics.

Why say this? Because it is obvious that, there's a tight connection between explanation and understanding. But whether we understand something surely depend on our epistemology and psychology. The pressure on Lewis is to defend that, some information can be explanatory purely out of metaphysical reasons, while maintaining this tight connection.

Lewis' reply is that, to understand something is just to possess enough explanatory information. ==Lewis 1986, 28== However, this seems wrong. On Lewis's picture, the first billion years of the causal history leading to the window's breaking would count as a huge body of explanatory information. If understanding were simply possessing enough explanatory information, and if explanatory information just about metaphysical structure, then learning about that first billion-year history should greatly improve our understanding of why the window broke. It plainly does not. Therefore, as Hall argues, the more plausible approach is to say that what makes some information explanatory is whether it improves our understanding, not that we understand by merely possessing explanatory information. Given Hall's view that what counts as explanatory depends on whether it produces understanding, then it opens up the possiblity to reject {::2}: information about grounding structure may track the order of our *understanding*, not the order of reality.

But surely this argument merely opens up an alternative to {::2}. {::2} is not shown to be false. Epistemology and psychology could play a role in determining whether a chunck of information is explanatory. But it does not follow that, the sole source of explanatory information is our epistemology and psychology. Maybe metaphysical facts still play a role in producing understanding.

A requirement for good explanatory act seems to be to produce understanding. However, to understand is just to possess explanatory information. Therefore, this requirement simply says an act fails to convey information.

Hall's critique: 

1. According to Lewis, explanatory info is causal history. But even if I successfully convey the causal history of the first billion years of the window breaking, I am not close to understanding why the window breaks; 
2. Sequestering epistemology and human psychology does not require act/information distinction.

### 1.3 An attractive foil

How does Lewis' argument apply to the Plausible Path? The step that Lewis took: explanatory information is about some *structure*. The project of fundamentality is to extend it not just to causal structure, but also to metaphysical structure. Therefore, the explanatory act is backed by the explanatory information about the metaphysical structure.

Critical issue: should we leave epistemic and psychological considerations out of our account of explanatory information?

## 2. Two case studies

The aim of the case studies A: human psychology not just affect the right way to convey information; it affacts what count as explanatory information.

The aim of the case studies B: why structures that looks metaphysical has a epistemic foundation; Provide precedent for epistemic approach.

### 2.1 Numbers

An appropriate answer to the question "What is 55 times 27" is the decimal representation "1485", not "55 times 27", or "the product of 15 and 99". But the decimal representation is just $1 \times 10^{4}+ 4 \times 10^{3} + 8 \times 10^{2} + 5 \times 10^{1}$. What makes the decimal representation stands out?

The temptation to go metaphysical: it reveals the metaphyscal essence of the number in question. Hall: this is crazy. The obvious answer is that, we were trained from early childhood to use algorithms under decimal representation. Therefore, the decimal representation is distinctly *useful* for us

Lewis can say: $55 \times 27$, $15 \times 99$ or the decimal/heximal/binary representation has the same information; But only decimal conveys the information more effectively.
Hall: Assume this is so, what singles out the decimal representation? There's still need a pragmatic story to tell.So psychology plays a role, one way or another. (Proof by intimidation?)

Explanatory information is the right kind of information an answer should convey when we ask "Why X?". But in general, given a question, what makes some information the right kind? Hall argues that answer-appropriateness can depend on epistemic considerations. Consider: "What is 55 times 27?" An apt answer is "1485," not "the product of 55 and 27" and not "the product of 15 and 99." But note that "1485" is just an abbreviation for the decimal expansion $1\times10^{3} + 4\times10^{2} + 8\times10^{1} + 5\times10^{0}$. All three responses pick out the same number; they differ only in how we pick it out. There is no plausible metaphysical reason to privilege "1485." It would be odd to say that the decimal expansion discloses the number's true nature. The more plausible explanation is epistemological: since childhood, we are trained to manipulate decimal notation. "1485" is the most *useful* representation for our arithmetic reasoning.
