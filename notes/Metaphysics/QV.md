**Interpretive Charity Claim**: The most rational way to interpret people's language is to make their utterance comes out reasonable; 

Including 

- charity to understanding: Exclude Putnam's model argument
- charity to perception: When there's a conflict between abstract claim and perceptual claim, perceptual claim trumps
- charity to retraction: Exclude empirical cases like "whales are fish" 

Given interpretive charity, any one of ME, MH, 4D and 3D can interpret each other's language as true in their own language. That is to say, they are truth-equivalent languages.

Potential Attack:

- Charity to eligibility: "plus and quus", reference magnetism ask us to interpret language to world's "logical joints"
	- Problem 1: What's logical joints? Either it's unintelligible or every language trivially carves joints?
	- Problem 2: Even if there are joints, why would we want to interpret words to carve joints?
- Charity to expressiveness: interpret more s-facts
	- Problem: Why so?

What's the reason to interpret people's words charitably?

Principle of charity is motivated by radical interpretation: 

The initial paradox: we need to know what they believe in order to know what their language mean, but we need to know what their language mean in order to understand their belief report.

Solution: We should guess their belief by their behavior; Then we reverse-engineer the meaning of their sentence according to their belief. Then we try to see if this interpretation (extendable in general) of meaning makes their belief and behavior coherent.

Problem 0: We started out assuming we hold very similar belief, i.e. we assume we don't disagree with each other. The of course you would get the conclusion that we are not disagreeing with each other.
- Rpy: But what's the alternative? 
	- Possibility 1. Assuming that the other people have mental issue? After some doctors do that and diagnose that some people are crazy -- but they have empirical evidence to show that these people are crazy.
	- Possibility 2. 

we can construct a weak language (say, disjuctive language/celieve/ontological maximalism, which introduce weaker concepts that extends ordinary domain) to express the same thing as a stronger language. And since the weak language is weaker, it may express more things than a strong language. The principle is, however, whether the atomic weak sentence can entail anything that has epistemic value to us. celieve or similar construction does not entail anything that concepts that are "simple to us": it only goes "deeper" in hierarchy, but never goes back to common sense. We can obviously posit A to explain B without knowing what is A. In some sense, it never says: If weakened construction, then we get what's simple to us.

(Common sense as the minimal value baseline; Scientific language has the virtue of helping us predict and control ordinary life. The explanation does not seems vacuous because of the new phenomenon/experiment it discovers. For example, assumptions about atoms, etc. help us create new medicine. In other words, it helps us predict and thus realize what sort of phenomena may occur in the reality. Maybe this kind of phenomena, like double-split experiment, will never occur in nature. Therefore these theoretical assumption obviously has some merit other than just explaining reality. But obviously explanation is also a practice, and thus you can say explanation is already of merit. Pragmatic value, in that sense, would comes in degree. But the difference is that, purely explanatory purpose does not, however, change the world. Or maybe it can change how we view it, and thus spur some intuition to create new theories? 

On thing about unobservable entities like atoms is that we understand them by analogy: we understand them as balls or something. And we experience force. laws of nature/induction expands explanation to prediction.

Fundamentality by stipulation: We can stipulate a structure by making use of hypothetical entities.)

Of course there can be some value in speaking in this language, such as playing a game to challenge oneself. Board games like go is like this: we introduce many abstract rules and people are just so into it. There's nothing bad at it. Maybe it exercises brain and help brain neurons grow. But what's the philosophical virtue about speaking this kind of language?



Formal system used in science, like quantum mechanics, uses extremely abstract mathematical tools. But eventually these tools yield results that goes back to common sense.

can do experiment that creates new phenomenon that eventually interprets to our observation. 


Problem 1: how do we interpret parrots?
Geometry expressiveness

Charity to retraction: if someone's brain is took out, replaced with an electronic brain, he will still say "my hand". I does not refer to my brain.

**Verbal dispute claim**: If metaphysical debate is the debate between truth-equivalent languages, then it's merely verbal (and should be terminated)

---

Potential attack: 

Why this is the right way to define verbal dispute?

---

**Solution claim**: A verbal dispute can be resolved by common sense.

---

Potential attack:

We *should* use common sense English? Where does that come from? Aren't they equally good?
