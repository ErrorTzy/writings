## 2.1 More Than A Material World

Granted that concrete, familiar, material objects of world exists, do any other things, like numbers exist?

If we adopt Quine's method of finding out ontological commitment of mathematics, and we think mathematics are true theories, then numbers exist

## 2.2 The Abstract/Concrete Distinction

Concrete entities are usually observable; Abstract entities are not.

Some tricky cases: electrons, spacetime, colors, particular color, events

**Problem**: How to distinguish between abstract and concrete?

**Tentative answer**: abstract entities are abstraction from concrete object

**Two ways to understand abstraction**

1. Psychological: Thinking about an object while ignoring its features; Mind dependent
2. Metaphysical: A kind of relation, the abstract thing lacks some feature of the concrete one.

## 2.3 Universals and the one over many argument

**universal**: A type of entity that can be repeated, and may be instantiated in multiple locations at once by distinct objects.

**instantiation**: When an universal instantiates, it is *wholly* present in these objects, not just partly.

**Plato's theory:** Forms are repeatable, transcendent (as opposed to immanent, i.e. in space and time), ideal (the form of beauty is not ugly at all), knowable only through pure intellect

**Aristotelian**: (Armstrong), abstract, universal, immanent, knowable by observation

**Realism**: Universals exist, mind independent
**Conceptualism**: Universals exist, mind dependent
**Nominalism**: Universals do not exist

**Argument for Realism (One Over Many)**

1. There are red houses, red roses and red sunsets
2. Therefore, redness exists

**Strong version**: abundant theory of universals, no restriction on universals
**Weak version**: sparse theory of universals, restriction on universals, distinguish "genuine" similarity

## 2.4 Applying Quine's Method

**Problem**: If we translate the premise of one over many argument, then there is no ontological commitment for universals.

**Armstrong's solution**: adding principle to make it valid

1. There are red houses, red roses and red sunsets
2. If somethings are red, they are genuinely similar
3. If a group of object is genuinely similar, then there is some entity they all instantiate
4. Therefore, redness exists

**Problem**: Quine is not going to accept these two bloated premises. 

**Alternative's solution**: Applying second order logic

**Problem**: First, second order logic is incomplete; Second, second order logic presuppose there is a distinction between existence, i.e. things and attributes

Ultimately, Quine and Armstrong disagree with the methodology of doing metaphysics. Armstrong thinks existence is more than ontological commitments in first order logic because we want *metaphysical explanation* for their similarity.

The view that supports Armstrong: truthmaker theory, truthmaker is state of affairs


**A further problem for Quine**: Consider the following sentence:

- Red is similar to pink

In the most natural reading, its ontological commitment include the entity "red."

If Quineans don't accept this, they must either 

1. offer reason to prefer the non-literal reading that does not commit that red exists, or
2. allow the original sentence to commit abstract entity, and it is false

## 2.5 Nominalism and Other Options

**Ostrich(Predicate) Nominalism**: There exists only words for properties but there's no properties. Refuse to answer why objects seems similar

**Set/Class Nominalism**: Abstract entities like sets and classes exist, but there's no universal. When we say red, we are just referring to the set of objects that are red.

- **Objection**: If set nominalism is right, then we cannot distinguish predicates with the same extension but different intension.
- **Defense**: The set does not include all actual objects, but all possible objects

Can set nominalism be sparse, since naturally there's no restriction on forming sets, making it abundant?

Lewis: sets are different because some properties are *natural* but some are not.

**Trope theory (Theory of abstract particulars)**: Abstract entities exist but there's no universal. Particulars instantiates *its own properties*. Universal are just the collection of all red tropes

**Feature of trope theory**: property exists but universals don't; Usually trope theorists claim that everything that exists is a trope.

## 2.6 Mathematical Objects

Plato: numbers are forms
Quine: First-order logic does not lead us to commit that numbers exists

**Indispensability Argument for mathematical realism**:

1. We ought to have ontological commitment to all that is indispensable to our best scientific theories
2. Mathematical entities are indispensable to our best scientific theories.
3. Therefore, we ought to have ontological commitment to mathematical entities

**Objection to 1**: Some indispensable parts of science are not supposed to have ontological commitment:

1. **Anti-realism**: Maddy, BVF: we are not required to believe in atoms
2. **Idealizations**: Science always use false assumptions for idealizations. Ontological commitments is thus more complicated.

**Objection to 2**: Harty Field, Science without numbers


**Deeper Problem (Benacerraf's Dilemma)**: When we want to give an account of mathematical truth, we need a semantic theory of this truth, and an epistemic account of how we know it. The problem is, it seems hard to have a consistent theory that satisfy both.
