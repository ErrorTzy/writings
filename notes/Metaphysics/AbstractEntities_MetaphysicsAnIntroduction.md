## 2.1 More Than A Material World

Granted that concrete, familiar, material objects of world exists, do any other things, like numbers exist?

If we adopt Quine's method of finding out ontological commitment of mathematics, and we think mathematics are true theories, then numbers exist

## 2.2 The Abstract/Concrete Distinction

Concrete entities are usually observable; Abstract entities are not.

Some tricky cases: electrons, spacetime, colors, particular color, events

**Problem**: How to distinguish between abstract and concrete?

**Tentative answer**: abstract entities are abstraction from concrete object

**Two ways to understand abstraction**

1. Psychological: Thinking about an object while ignoring its features; Mind dependent
2. Metaphysical: A kind of relation, the abstract thing lacks some feature of the concrete one.

## 2.3 Universals and the one over many argument

**universal**: A type of entity that can be repeated, and may be instantiated in multiple locations at once by distinct objects.

**instantiation**: When an universal instantiates, it is *wholly* present in these objects, not just partly.

**Plato's theory:** Forms are repeatable, transcendent (as opposed to immanent, i.e. in space and time), ideal (the form of beauty is not ugly at all), knowable only through pure intellect

**Aristotelian**: (Armstrong), abstract, universal, immanent, knowable by observation

**Realism**: Universals exist, mind independent
**Conceptualism**: Universals exist, mind dependent
**Nominalism**: Universals do not exist

**Argument for Realism (One Over Many)**

1. There are red houses, red roses and red sunsets
2. Therefore, redness exists

**Strong version**: abundant theory of universals, no restriction on universals
**Weak version**: sparse theory of universals, restriction on universals, distinguish "genuine" similarity

## 2.4 Applying Quine's Method

If we translate the premise of one over many argument, then there is no ontological commitment for universals.
