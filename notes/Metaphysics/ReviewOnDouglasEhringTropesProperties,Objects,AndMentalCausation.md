NCTN: Natural Class Trope Nominalism

## Main Claims:

1. If something conforms the identity of indiscernibles, then it is not a particular
2. Enduring tropes exist as needed to distinguish moving from stationary property instances. Types are collection of tropes; A trope can be a member of multiple collections, and so fall under multiple types
3. Identity of two tropes are primitive and unanalyzable
4. An object is the mereological sum of compresent tropes, where compresence is a primitive self-relating bundling relation, and persistence of objects is understood in counterpart-theoretic terms
5. Problems with mental causation can be addressed by taking tropes to be causal relata, taking mental and physical tropes as identical and taking mental and physical types as distinct
6. The best theory of trope theory is NCTN, on which trope membership in natural classes is prior in the order of metaphysical explanation to trope natures and object resemblance
7. Certain objections to NCTN can be answered by adopting a counterpart theory of properties

## The distinction between universals and particulars
