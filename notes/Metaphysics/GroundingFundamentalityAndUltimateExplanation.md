## I. Groundwork: Grounding and Fundamentally

Grounding is a kind of relationship between things

**Examples**:

1. the existence of a trumpet seems to be grounded on the existence of its parts
2. Wars seems to be grounded on events
3. Number 7 seems to be grounded on the mathematical structure it's embedded in
4. The truth of universal generalization seems to be grounded on particular instances

**Features of grounding (Preliminary)**:

1. Non-causal
2. A lot of different entities (possibility all) have grounding relation
3. Related to whole and parts
4. Has hierarchy, thus asymmetric
5. Involved with a non-causal explanation

### 1.1 Grounding: The Framework and Some of its controversies

There are some intuitive examples, but there are few agreement

#### 1.1.1 The Relata

**What can be relata?**

- **Entity-grounding View**: Everything can be relata
- **Propositional-grounding View**: Only propositional structures can be relata
	- **Fact**: Rosen 2010
	- **Sentences**: Fine 2012

**Propositional view**: 

- **Example**: Set is not ground on its members; The proposition that "Sets exist" is grounded on "Members of sets exist"
- **Upside**: It has a closer connection between grounding and explanation: The table exists because its parts exists.

#### 1.1.2 The Relation

**Is grounding real?**

- **Sentential Connective**: "because" or "in virtue of" are sentential connectives like "and," "but," etc. Does not have metaphysical commitment about grounding relation
- **Relational Predicate**:  "because" or "in virtue of" are relational predicate like "A is behind B". Grounding is a real, metaphysical relation.

**Is grounding over and above explanation?** 

- **Unionists**: grounding is metaphysical explanation
- **Separatists**: grounding underwrites explanation but is not identical (Raven 2015, Maurin 2019, Brenner et al 2021)

**Motivation**:

- **Unionists**: Both are asymmetric, transitive, irreflexive, non-monotonic and hyperintensional
- **Separatists**: grounding is objective and mind-independent, whereas explanation is thought to be inextricably tied up in our cognitive lives.
	- **Problem**: What is the relation between grounding and explanation then? If it is a grounding relation, it seems we need to beg the question to understand grounding in the first place

#### 1.1.3 Further Import Features

Grounding: absolute or plural?

**Conceptual: Is grounding one or many?**

- **Small-g**: membership, proper parthood, subset, determinate/determinable relation; To say that $x$ grounds $y$ is to say $x$ bears one of these relation with $y$.
- **Big-g**: generic, distinctive grounding relation

**Possible Solution**:

1. big-G and small-g are like genus and species
2. big-G is a "covering term" (Thomasson 2007)
3. big-G is unique and tracks what we refer to when we use small-g terms (Schaffer)

Metaphysical: Is reality one overarching ordering, or several series of ordering?

**Metaphysical: Is there an overarching superstructure of the world?**

- Yes
- No, grounding is relativized

**Fully ground vs. partially ground**: Socrates grounds $\{Socrates\}$, but Socrates' lever partially ground Socrates

### 1.2 Fundamentality

**A parallel** (between epistemic and metaphysical fundamentality): fundamentalist, infinitist and coherentist

**Two senses of fundamentality**: absolute fundamentality and relative fundamentality

The language of relative fundamentality does not require absolute fundamentality

In the rest of the book, fundamentality means absolute fundamentality

#### 1.2.1 Absolute Fundamentally

**Fundamentality thesis**: There is some x such that x is fundamental.

Kit Fine and Jessica Wilson: fundamentality is primitive

##### 1.2.1.1 Independence

**Independence of fundamentals**: If x is fundamental, then x is ungrounded

Different interpretations: x is independent if 

1. $\neg \exists y Gyx$
2. $\forall R \in g (\neg \exists y Ryx)$
3. $\exists R \in g (\neg \exists y Ryx)$

1 and 2 are absolute, 3 is rather relativized fundamentality

##### 1.2.1.2 Completeness

**Completeness of fundamentals**: Some x is complete iff x at world w grounds everything else at w

And thus we can also define a concept "uniquely minimally complete" by restricting it to the smallest set that is fundamental

##### 1.2.1.3 Indispensable

Raven 2016: Suppose there is a world where everything is material and everything has parts. Therefore, nothing is foundational but the property of being material is not eliminatable, therefore fundamental.

##### 1.2.1.4 Naturalness

Lewis and Sider's view: Joint carving, etc.

Sets are natural but not independently exist

### 1.3 Unexplained

The general view is about mostly independence and partly completeness. Indispensability is an alternative, naturalness is too heavyweight.

## 2 Ultimate Explanations: An Idea and its History

Old topics like "God," "The one," "Being," "Ultimate Reality," etc.

### 2.1 Grounding Old or New

Distinction: 

- **Question of ground**: Piety because of love of gods, or Love of gods because of piety
- **Question about ground**: Whether ground is necessarily irreflexive, transitive and asymmetric

Problem of this distinction: This does not prove that grounding is new; Historically there are questions about ground, and contemporary philosophers also think about questions of ground.

More plausible distinct: directly and indirectly talk about problems

A lot of topics in the history of philosophy can be understood as grounding talk in different terms

### 2.2 Ultimate Explanation

Definition (Ultimate Explanation)

: Ultimate explanation are explanations that aim at explaining some phenomenon in its *generality*

**Examples**: "Why there are justified beliefs?" is requesting *ultimate explanation* about the existence of justified beliefs per se. It then cannot be answered by giving an instance of justified belief (because therefore I would question why this instance is an justified belief); The explainer is typical beyond (different from) any member of the explanatory target

**Explanatory target**: "x is," or x stands in need of explanation

**Explanatory Assumption**: x cannot explain x (or "x is F" cannot explain "x is F")

### 2.3 Ultimate Explainers

Definition (Ultimate Explainers)

~ 1. Natural and non-arbitrary stopping point of explanation
~ 2. It is explanatory
~ 3. It is relevant

**Remark on 1**: what does it mean to be a "natural and non-arbitrary" stopping point? It's better explained in terms of the explainer itself does not lead us to posit it in the first place, i.e. it does not stand in need of explanation (in the same way?)

**Remark on 2**: For A to be explanatory for B is to say that A bears the right kind of explanatory relation with B. 

**Remark on 3**: It might be understood as, given a background theoretical framework, the stopping point will fix the explanatory chain. (Once we determined what explains there are justified beliefs, we can determine justified beliefs) For example, given that numbers do not have causal power and explanation needs causal power, numbers are not relevant

**Fundamentality and ultimate explanation**:
We presuppose that grounding relation is a right kind of relation for explanation. Independence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being an ultimate explainer, as long as there are independent things that are isolated. If we want everything fundamental to explain, we need to guarantee that everything is ground on fundamental things. Therefore we can define:

**Ultimate Explainers**: x is an ultimate explainer if $x$ is independent and $x \in F$ such that $F$ is complete

### 2.4 Some Historic Examples

#### 2.4.1 Prime Matter

Aristotelian hylomorphism: Form + Matter = Substance;

- Level 4: Personhood + Flesh = Me, by accident have Australianhood
- Level 3: Fleshhood + Cells = Flesh, by accident have personhood
- Level 2: Cellhood + Molecules = Biological Matter, by accident have fleshhood
- Level 1: Biological Matterhood + Prime matter = Molecules, by accident have cellhood
- Level 0: Prime matter, by accident have biological matterhood.

The prime matter is the ultimate explainer.

**Remark**: There are many possible ways to interpret Aristotle, and it is not clear why Aristotle must need prime number. One answer is that Aristotle's opposition to infinity

#### 2.4.2 God

Consider we have infinitely many books, each is explained by it's copied from another book. Since we have infinitely many books, each book is explained. But then you may still ask: 

- Why have there always been such books?
- Why were these books written?
- Why were they written in the way they were?

Different states of the world of contingent things is like a book. ==Is it necessary that there must be such answers to these questions?==

#### 2.4.3 Being

"Being" in Heidegger

## 3 The Metaphysics of Fundamentality

what something needs to be like in order to be the ultimate ground?

### 3.1 Well-foundedness

Definition (Well-foundedness)

: For any existence, there must be an finite step to reach the fundamental existence.

We should not take well-foundedness as the requirement because we can have infinitely descending grounding chain in Euclidean Space.

### 3.2 Purity

Definition (Purity about facts)

: Fundamental facts involve only fundamental constituents

**Problem**: The fact "Socrates grounds {Socrates}" cannot be fundamental, according to the purity principle. But all grounding fact must have one foot which is not fundamental. Therefore no grounding fact is fundamental. Therefore, grounding relation is not fundamental. ==how does this follow? Maybe see Barker 2022== But we want grounding to be primitive and written into the book of the world

### 3.3 A Free Lunch

Non-fundamental entities are an ontological free lunch; A fundamental version of the razor, the 

**Lasor**: We must not multiply *fundamental* entities beyond necessity.

How to define "free launch"/"metaphysically innocent"?

Everything derivative finds its full ground in the fundamental

Problem: why should we stick to Lasor?

### 3.4 On the Aptness to Ultimate Explain

#### 3.4.1 Priority Pluralism

What are fundamental? *Something at the bottom of the mereological relation of the world*

The whole is grounded in parts; Therefore we need to track down the mereological relation. If we are committed to physicalism, then the basic particles are the fundamental entities

#### 3.4.2 Priority Monism

What are fundamental? *Something at the top of the mereological relation of the world*

The cosmos grounds all; Somehow the grounding direction tracks upwards

#### 3.4.3 Middleism

What are fundamental? *Something in the middle of the mereological relation of the world*

To create the world, God just need to create something in the middle, like bikes or alarm clocks. This is also compatible with anti-fundamentalism. One could still choose to be a plural-middleist or mono-middleist, though.

#### 3.4.4 Essences

What are fundamental? *Essences*.

Dasgupta: Three kinds of facts

1. Facts that are apt to be grounded and have grounds
2. Facts that are apt to have grounds and happen not to have them
3. Facts that are not apt to have grounds at all

(1) and (2) are named "substantive facts" and (3) is named "autonomous fact"

**Examples**:

1. Substantive: The sky is blue
2. Autonomous: All bachelors are unmarried males

==I can't ask why 2? I can't ask "why is it defined this way?"==

Facts about essence are autonomous facts; Therefore it seems to be an non-arbitrary stopping point.

## 4 The Epistemology of Fundamentality: Regress, Virtues and other Desiderata

### 4.1 The Regress Problem (for fundamentality)

Explanation for existence

- Causation explanation: How the watch came to be
- Metaphysical explanation: it has bezel, case, crown, etc

**Problem**: 

1. If for a metaphysical explanation of A, one must needs to appeal to its parts, then A never gets (fully) explained. (Even if the bottom it has no parts, since bottom is not explained, there's still something left unexplained.) (We should not say that, regression leads to no explanation at all. This is because at each stage, there is a successful answer. The successful answer, to the extent that answers the relevant question at this stage, is considered sufficient.)

**There's no need to posit fundamental entity**:

1. If there's nothing left unexplained in infinite regress, then there's no need to posit fundamental entity
	- What's left unexplained? If it's infinite, then nothing is left unexplained. Maybe you are saying I'm not explaining the totality? But if it's ground, then nothing is left over. (see Bliss 2019b)

2. Even if there's something left unexplained, positing fundamental entity does not help
	- Maybe everything is explained but there's still something inadequate? Suppose C -E-> B -E-> A; Then the C,B is partial ground for B,A? But there's no reason to say they are partial ground; Second, non-fundamental things could as well be full grounds. Therefore, there's no need to posit fundamental 

3. Who says incomplete explanation is problematic? We are okay with incomplete causal explanation all the time. There's no need to posit fundamental entity.

**Response**:

The argument mentioned in 2.2 ultimate explanation:

1. (Explanation Target) There is an explanation for the fact that there are any derivative entities whatsoever
2. (Explanatory Assumption) No derivative entities can explain why there are any derivative entities whatsoever
3. Therefore, there must be something fundamental.

2 is justified through the badness of vicious regression: the explanation goal cannot be achieved if there's a regression;

Example: Why does this flamingo exist? If you track the parents, then you can never explain why there is any flamingo. Therefore we can formulate a principle: *no instance of a kind can explain how kinds exist in the first place.*

### 4.2 Theoretical Virtues

**Theoretical virtue**: it could be better if there are fundamental entities

Fundamental entities make a theory more unified: fundamental entities explain everything, while infinitism can only do separate explanation.

**Objection 1**: There might be three argument saying that it fundamental entities unifies a theory

1. there is a subset of (plurality of) fundamental entities that ultimately grounds some non-fundamental one
2. there is a set (plurality) of fundamental entities that ultimately grounds some non-fundamental one
3. there is a single fundamentum that grounds some non-fundamental one

Problem with (1): we can have a unified explanation with a set of non-fundamental entities
Problem with (2): every member in this set seems to explain everything
Problem with (3): it is like committing to god or monism, which is crazy

**Reply to 1**: fundamentals can do what infinitist can't, i.e. the regression problem.

**Objection 2**: Infinitism is simpler with regard to the category of entity, i.e. the derivative. Fundamentalism needs the derivative and the fundamental

### 4.3 Taking Stock

The argument in 4.1, i.e. why there are a kind of thing at all, *in their generality*

## 5 Fundamentality

problems with fundamentalism and its alternatives

### 5.1 The Trouble with Fundamentality

The traditional problem: how could there be such a thing as god?

What we should focus on:

1. What exactly it is that the fundamental are supposed to be doing?
2. What work are they invoked in service to?

#### 5.1.1 What work the fundamental?

**Schaffer's account**: If mereological explanation has infinite regression, then the explanation is always deferred and never really accounted for

- Explanatory Target: (particular) beings
- Externality Assumption: No being whose being also needs to be accounted for can account for the being of any other particular being

**Dasgupta's account**: "Why does things exists in general" cannot be answered by any particular explanation of existence. (unlike Shaffer, local beings can be accounted for)

- Explanatory Target: How things turned out this way
- Externality Assumption: No non-fundamental can explain how so

**Bliss' account**:

- Explanatory target: Why there are any derivative entities whatsoever
- Externality Assumptions: No derivative entity can explain why so

**Problem 1 (Escaping PSR)**: All these three argument seems to rely on some version of PSR. But (1) PSR seems wrong because of quantum mechanics or it is not defended anyway; and (2) fundamental entities themselves seem to violate PSR.

(2) is problematic; we need to explain why the fundamental can escape the scope of PSR in an non-ad hoc way.

**Task**: why the fundamental can escape the scope of PSR in an non-ad hoc way

- Schaffer: fundamental entities just don't need explanation
- Dasgupta: there are autonomous facts which don't have and don't need explanations

But they all seems ad hoc

**Problem 2 (Target is just a general fact)**: if we treat the explanatory target as a *general fact*, then there's no need to ask for further explanation. The general fact is grounded in all instances. Then the question seems to be just a variant of "Why there's something, rather than nothing?" Which is regarded as nonsensical.

**Problem 3 (Why externality assumption)**: Why should we believe the externality assumption? It seems we explain one derivative entity with another all the time. For example, the singleton Socrates is grounded on Socrates, and this is a full explanation. We need another requirement (e.g. complete explanation) in order to motivate externality assumption.

#### 5.1.2 Overdetermination

**Causal overdetermination**: some E is causally overdetermined if it has two distinct, individually sufficient causes $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$

Then we can formulate a similar thesis:

**Metaphysical overdetermination**: some E is metaphysically overdetermined if it has two distinct, individually sufficient grounds $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$

**Remark**: If we understand "distinct" as ground-theoretical term, i.e. two facts are distinct iff they do not ground each other or there is a third ground grounding both, then *priority monism* can avoid overdetermination because everything is grounded by the cosmos; But *priority pluralism* seems to suffer from overdetermination.

**Why is overdetermination bad?** It seems that, if we have too many (ultimate) explanation, then we have too many fundamental entities. Since fundamental entities are costly, the theory is costly. ==Is there any toy counterexample?==

**Two possible motives for fundamenta in overdetermination** (e.g. singleton Socrates is fully explained by Socrates and some fundamenta):

1. fundamenta *ultimately* explains
2. fundamenta explains how things exist more generally

**Two kinds of grounding**: grounded in the non-fundamentals and ground in the fundamentals

### 5.2 The Alternatives

Metaphysical infinitism and metaphysical coherentism

#### 5.2.1 Metaphysical Infinitism

Features:

1. Nothing fundamental
2. Admits the strictly hierarchical structure

If metaphysical infinitism metaphysically possible?

**No**: because it gives rise to a vicious infinite regression; And infinite regression may lead to (1) nothing is explained

- **Objection**: Of course things are explained. 
	- **Defense**: But you don't have ultimate explanation
	- **Objection**: What do you mean "ultimate explanation"? If you mean an explanation that is not infinite, then this object is just begging the question. We don't need ultimate explanation.

**No**: (2) something is not explained, like the generality of facts

- **Objection**: appeal to the argument in 5.1: PSR is wrong, or explanatory target is just general facts.
- **Defense**: (1) If a collection can be explained by its parts, then it would be self explanatory -- but consider a conjunction: it is grounded and explained by all of its conjuncts. (2) Never ending question is bad -- but why? because they are never-ending? (3) The answer of derivative object explaining is not satisfying per se. There is regression because we keep getting the wrong answer. This is a wrong answer because of (4) the kind-instantiation principle:

**The kind-instantiation principle (KI)**: Where K is any *substantial kind*, you can't explanation for why where are any derivative entities whatsoever.

Therefore, the argument for the externality assumption goes like this:

(a) The kind-instantiation principle
(b) Derivative entity is a *substantial kind*
(c) Therefore, you cannot explain why there are any derivative entities at all by invoking only derivative entities, even if your explanation goes on forever.

- **Objection**: derivative entity is not a substantial kind. It might be a dummy sortal or covering term.

**Dummy sortals**: Unlike substantive sortals which provides criteria for identify, dummy sortals like "things" grammatically look like a sortals but rely on other sortals to count as identifying. E.g. How many *things* did you receive last Christmas?

If "derivative entity" is a *dummy sortal*, then the question "why are there any dummy sortals at all" does not pick any target out. If so, fundamentalism is defective.

**Covering term**: Something is a covering term if it covers various kinds, e.g. the small-g is a covering term for various kinds of relations.

If "derivative entity" is a *covering term*, then the question will be "why you exist, and why I exist, ...", which does not need to posit fundamental entities.

#### 5.2.2 Metaphysical Coherentism

Two features:

1. Nothing fundamental
2. Admits of loops (deny the strictly hierarchical structure)

**Weak coherentism**: grounding is anti-symmetric, transitive, non-reflexive. There's just some loop.
**Strong coherentism**: grounding is symmetric, transitive and reflexive. Everything is grounded in everything including itself.

**Remark**: Strong coherentism is crazy. Why it is even possible? Some mad Buddhists talk like this. But we can ignore them for now. Weak coherentism is more plausible because of some examples: explanatory holism, north pole and south pole of a magnet, etc. One thing needs to be noticed: any loop is an infinite regress, so whatever infinitism is facing, coherentism is also facing with it.

Why being circular is problematic at all?

**Distinction**:

- **big loop**: allow $Gxy,Gyz,Gzx$, but deny the case of $Gxx$ (deny transitivity)
- **small loop**: allow $Gxx$, but deny the possibility of $Gxy,Gyz,Gzx$.

**Problem for big loop**: for a time traveling case where creates a causal loop, we would ask how would this loop happen in the first place. (I was informed about how to build a time machine, I built it and told the past me how to build a time machine -- but how do I get the instruction in the first place??) Therefore for grounding, we may also ask how to break into the circle at all.

- **Objection 1**: the concern in the time traveling case is about temporal priority, but it does not carry to grounding.
- **Objection 2**: this concern is misguided, because what explains the loop are just the members

**Problem for small loop**: 

(1) it may as well just collapse to fundamentalism; and 
(2) it seems to flout ontological priority, since if A grounds A, A should in some sense comes before A -- but this seems begging the question. If I deny the hierarchy, I would think this "come before" in the first place.
(3) To explain A by A seems not explanatory at all, but grounding seems to explain

**Defense for small loop**: Self-groundedness is trivial, just like how self-identity is trivial.

the strongest motivation for fundamentalism is probably the demand for ultimate explanation. But if we define ultimate explanation in terms of non-arbitrary stopping point, then it would beg the question to say anti-fundamentalism cannot fulfill the demand




---

P1. Nothing is self-explanatory
P2. Any proposition can be an explanandum
P3. For any A and B, if A explains B, then there is a right kind of relation R such that A bears relation R with B.
P4. P3 is an explainan (of how any explanandum is explained)
P5. P3 is an explanandum (because P3 is a proposition)
P6. P2 is self-explanatory (from P5, P6)
