## I. Groundwork: Grounding and Fundamentally

Grounding is a kind of relationship between things

**Examples**:

1. the existence of a trumpet seems to be grounded on the existence of its parts
2. Wars seems to be grounded on events
3. Number 7 seems to be grounded on the mathematical structure it's embedded in
4. The truth of universal generalization seems to be grounded on particular instances

**Features of grounding (Preliminary)**:

1. Non-causal
2. A lot of different entities (possibility all) have grounding relation
3. Related to whole and parts
4. Has hierarchy, thus asymmetric
5. Involved with a non-causal explanation

## 1.1 Grounding: The Framework and Some of its controversies

There are some intuitive examples, but there are few agreement

### 1.1.1 The Relata

**What can be relata?**

- **Entity-grounding View**: Everything can be relata
- **Propositional-grounding View**: Only propositional structures can be relata
	- **Fact**: Rosen 2010
	- **Sentences**: Fine 2012

**Propositional view**: 

- **Example**: Set is not ground on its members; The proposition that "Sets exist" is grounded on "Members of sets exist"
- **Upside**: It has a closer connection between grounding and explanation: The table exists because its parts exists.

### 1.1.2 The Relation

**Is grounding real?**

- **Sentential Connective**: "because" or "in virtue of" are sentential connectives like "and," "but," etc. Does not have metaphysical commitment about grounding relation
- **Relational Predicate**:  "because" or "in virtue of" are relational predicate like "A is behind B". Grounding is a real, metaphysical relation.

**Is grounding over and above explanation?** 

- **Unionists**: grounding is metaphysical explanation
- **Separatists**: grounding underwrites explanation but is not identical (Raven 2015, Maurin 2019, Brenner et al 2021)

**Motivation**:

- **Unionists**: Both are asymmetric, transitive, irreflexive, non-monotonic and hyperintensional
- **Separatists**: grounding is objective and mind-independent, whereas explanation is thought to be inextricably tied up in our cognitive lives.
	- **Problem**: What is the relation between grounding and explanation then? If it is a grounding relation, it seems we need to beg the question to understand grounding in the first place

### 1.1.3 Further Import Features

Grounding: absolute or plural?

**Conceptual: Is grounding one or many?**

- **Small-g**: membership, proper parthood, subset, determinate/determinable relation; To say that $x$ grounds $y$ is to say $x$ bears one of these relation with $y$.
- **Big-g**: generic, distinctive grounding relation

**Possible Solution**:

1. big-G and small-g are like genus and species
2. big-G is a "covering term" (Thomasson 2007)
3. big-G is unique and tracks what we refer to when we use small-g terms (Schaffer)

Metaphysical: Is reality one overarching ordering, or several series of ordering?
