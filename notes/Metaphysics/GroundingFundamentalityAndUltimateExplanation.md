## I. Groundwork: Grounding and Fundamentally

Grounding is a kind of relationship between things

**Examples**:

1. the existence of a trumpet seems to be grounded on the existence of its parts
2. Wars seems to be grounded on events
3. Number 7 seems to be grounded on the mathematical structure it's embedded in
4. The truth of universal generalization seems to be grounded on particular instances

**Features of grounding (Preliminary)**:

1. Non-causal
2. A lot of different entities (possibility all) have grounding relation
3. Related to whole and parts
4. Has hierarchy, thus asymmetric
5. Involved with a non-causal explanation

### 1.1 Grounding: The Framework and Some of its controversies

There are some intuitive examples, but there are few agreement

#### 1.1.1 The Relata

**What can be relata?**

- **Entity-grounding View**: Everything can be relata
- **Propositional-grounding View**: Only propositional structures can be relata
	- **Fact**: Rosen 2010
	- **Sentences**: Fine 2012

**Propositional view**: 

- **Example**: Set is not ground on its members; The proposition that "Sets exist" is grounded on "Members of sets exist"
- **Upside**: It has a closer connection between grounding and explanation: The table exists because its parts exists.

#### 1.1.2 The Relation

**Is grounding real?**

- **Sentential Connective**: "because" or "in virtue of" are sentential connectives like "and," "but," etc. Does not have metaphysical commitment about grounding relation
- **Relational Predicate**:  "because" or "in virtue of" are relational predicate like "A is behind B". Grounding is a real, metaphysical relation.

**Is grounding over and above explanation?** 

- **Unionists**: grounding is metaphysical explanation
- **Separatists**: grounding underwrites explanation but is not identical (Raven 2015, Maurin 2019, Brenner et al 2021)

**Motivation**:

- **Unionists**: Both are asymmetric, transitive, irreflexive, non-monotonic and hyperintensional
- **Separatists**: grounding is objective and mind-independent, whereas explanation is thought to be inextricably tied up in our cognitive lives.
	- **Problem**: What is the relation between grounding and explanation then? If it is a grounding relation, it seems we need to beg the question to understand grounding in the first place

#### 1.1.3 Further Import Features

Grounding: absolute or plural?

**Conceptual: Is grounding one or many?**

- **Small-g**: membership, proper parthood, subset, determinate/determinable relation; To say that $x$ grounds $y$ is to say $x$ bears one of these relation with $y$.
- **Big-g**: generic, distinctive grounding relation

**Possible Solution**:

1. big-G and small-g are like genus and species
2. big-G is a "covering term" (Thomasson 2007)
3. big-G is unique and tracks what we refer to when we use small-g terms (Schaffer)

Metaphysical: Is reality one overarching ordering, or several series of ordering?

**Metaphysical: Is there an overarching superstructure of the world?**

- Yes
- No, grounding is relativized

**Fully ground vs. partially ground**: Socrates grounds $\{Socrates\}$, but Socrates' lever partially ground Socrates

### 1.2 Fundamentality

**A parallel** (between epistemic and metaphysical fundamentality): fundamentalist, infinitist and coherentist

**Two senses of fundamentality**: absolute fundamentality and relative fundamentality

The language of relative fundamentality does not require absolute fundamentality

In the rest of the book, fundamentality means absolute fundamentality

#### 1.2.1 Absolute Fundamentally

**Fundamentality thesis**: There is some x such that x is fundamental.

Kit Fine and Jessica Wilson: fundamentality is primitive

##### 1.2.1.1 Independence

**Independence of fundamentals**: If x is fundamental, then x is ungrounded

Different interpretations: x is independent if 

1. $\neg \exists y Gyx$
2. $\forall R \in g (\neg \exists y Ryx)$
3. $\exists R \in g (\neg \exists y Ryx)$

1 and 2 are absolute, 3 is rather relativized fundamentality

##### 1.2.1.2 Completeness

**Completeness of fundamentals**: Some x is complete iff x at world w grounds everything else at w

And thus we can also define a concept "uniquely minimally complete" by restricting it to the smallest set that is fundamental

##### 1.2.1.3 Indispensable

Raven 2016: Suppose there is a world where everything is material and everything has parts. Therefore, nothing is foundational but the property of being material is not eliminatable, therefore fundamental.

##### 1.2.1.4 Naturalness

Lewis and Sider's view: Joint carving, etc.

Sets are natural but not independently exist

### 1.3 Unexplained

The general view is about mostly independence and partly completeness. Indispensability is an alternative, naturalness is too heavyweight.

## 2 Ultimate Explanations: An Idea and its History

Old topics like "God," "The one," "Being," "Ultimate Reality," etc.

### 2.1 Grounding Old or New

Distinction: 

- **Question of ground**: Piety because of love of gods, or Love of gods because of piety
- **Question about ground**: Whether ground is necessarily irreflexive, transitive and asymmetric

Problem of this distinction: This does not prove that grounding is new; Historically there are questions about ground, and contemporary philosophers also think about questions of ground.

More plausible distinct: directly and indirectly talk about problems

A lot of topics in the history of philosophy can be understood as grounding talk in different terms

### 2.2 Ultimate Explanation

Definition (Ultimate Explanation)

: Ultimate explanation are explanations that aim at explaining some phenomenon in its *generality*

**Examples**: "Why there are justified beliefs?" is requesting *ultimate explanation* about the existence of justified beliefs per se. It then cannot be answered by giving an instance of justified belief (because therefore I would question why this instance is an justified belief); The explainer is typical beyond (different from) any member of the explanatory target

**Explanatory target**: "x is," or x stands in need of explanation

**Explanatory Assumption**: x cannot explain x (or "x is F" cannot explain "x is F")

### 2.3 Ultimate Explainers

Definition (Ultimate Explainers)

~ 1. Natural and non-arbitrary stopping point of explanation
~ 2. It is explanatory
~ 3. It is relevant

**Remark on 1**: what does it mean to be a "natural and non-arbitrary" stopping point? It's better explained in terms of the explainer itself does not lead us to posit it in the first place, i.e. it does not stand in need of explanation (in the same way?)

**Remark on 2**: For A to be explanatory for B is to say that A bears the right kind of explanatory relation with B. 

**Remark on 3**: It might be understood as, given a background theoretical framework, the stopping point will fix the explanatory chain. (Once we determined what explains there are justified beliefs, we can determine justified beliefs) For example, given that numbers do not have causal power and explanation needs causal power, numbers are not relevant

**Fundamentality and ultimate explanation**:
We presuppose that grounding relation is a right kind of relation for explanation. Independence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being an ultimate explainer, as long as there are independent things that are isolated. If we want everything fundamental to explain, we need to guarantee that everything is ground on fundamental things. Therefore we can define:

**Ultimate Explainers**: x is an ultimate explainer if $x$ is independent and $x \in F$ such that $F$ is complete

### 2.4 Some Historic Examples

#### 2.4.1 Prime Matter

Aristotelian hylomorphism: Form + Matter = Substance;

- Level 4: Personhood + Flesh = Me, by accident have Australianhood
- Level 3: Fleshhood + Cells = Flesh, by accident have personhood
- Level 2: Cellhood + Molecules = Biological Matter, by accident have fleshhood
- Level 1: Biological Matterhood + Prime matter = Molecules, by accident have cellhood
- Level 0: Prime matter, by accident have biological matterhood.

The prime matter is the ultimate explainer.

**Remark**: There are many possible ways to interpret Aristotle, and it is not clear why Aristotle must need prime number. One answer is that Aristotle's opposition to infinity

#### 2.4.2 God

Consider we have infinitely many books, each is explained by it's copied from another book. Since we have infinitely many books, each book is explained. But then you may still ask: 

- Why have there always been such books?
- Why were these books written?
- Why were they written in the way they were?

Different states of the world of contingent things is like a book. ==Is it necessary that there must be such answers to these questions?==

#### 2.4.3 Being

"Being" in Heidegger

## 3 The Metaphysics of Fundamentality

what something needs to be like in order to be the ultimate ground?

### 3.1 Well-foundedness

Definition (Well-foundedness)

: For any existence, there must be an finite step to reach the fundamental existence.

We should not take well-foundedness as the requirement because we can have infinitely descending grounding chain in Euclidean Space.

### 3.2 Purity

Definition (Purity about facts)

: Fundamental facts involve only fundamental constituents

**Problem**: The fact "Socrates grounds {Socrates}" cannot be fundamental, according to the purity principle. But all grounding fact must have one foot which is not fundamental. Therefore no grounding fact is fundamental. Therefore, grounding relation is not fundamental. ==how does this follow? Maybe see Barker 2022== But we want grounding to be primitive and written into the book of the world

### 3.3 A Free Lunch

Non-fundamental entities are an ontological free lunch; A fundamental version of the razor, the *Lasor*: We must not multiply *fundamental* entities beyond necessity.

How to define "free launch"/"metaphysically innocent"?

Everything derivative finds its full ground in the fundamental

Problem: why should we stick to Lasor?

### 3.4 On the Aptness to Ultimate Explain

#### 3.4.1 Priority Pluralism

What are fundamental? Something at the bottom of the mereological relation of the world

The whole is grounded in parts; Therefore we need to track down the mereological relation. If we are committed to physicalism, then the basic particles are the fundamental entities

#### 3.4.2 Priority Monism

What are fundamental? Something at the top of the mereological relation of the world

The cosmos grounds all; Somehow the grounding direction tracks upwards

#### 3.4.3 Middleism

What are fundamental? Something in the middle of the mereological relation of the world

To create the world, God just need to create something in the middle, like bikes or alarm clocks. This is also compatible with anti-fundamentalism. One could still choose to be a plural-middleist or mono-middleist, though.

#### 3.4.4 Essences

What are fundamental? *Essences*.


P1. Nothing is self-explanatory
P2. Any proposition can be an explanandum
P3. For any A and B, if A explains B, then there is a right kind of relation R such that A bears relation R with B.
P4. P3 is an explainan (of how any explanandum is explained)
P5. P3 is an explanandum (because P3 is a proposition)
P6. P2 is self-explanatory (from P5, P6)
