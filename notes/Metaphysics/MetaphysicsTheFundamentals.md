## 2 Truthmakers

**Correspondence theory of truth**

Sentence means meaning; Meaning corresponds the world.

### 2.1 Propositions

Traditional and plausible view of the meaning of a sentence: propositions

Note: a proposition must be representational in order to be true

**Question**: Why do we need a middleware, i.e. propositions? Can't we say sentence tokens represents the world?

1. Because we can say the same thing in different languages.
2. Propositions seem to capture the "same mental thought" in different language speaker's mind

### 2.2 Classical Truthmaker Theory

Definition (Truthmaker)

: $x$ is a truthmaker for the proposition $p$ iff

1. $p$ must be true if $x$ exists,
2. if $x$ exists and $p$ is true, the $p$ must be true at least in part because $x$ exits

#### 2.2.1 Three Arguments for Truthmakers

**Argument 1: From the correspondence theory to truthmakers**

- The correspondence theory is plausible, and this definition satisfies what the correspondence theory needs.

**Argument 2: Distinguishing Theories**

- Two theories can describe the world *in exactly the same way* with different terminology. Truthmaker can help us make sense of why this is so, and distinguish between "ontologically distinct" and "ideologically distinct": if there is some truthmaker that makes only one theory true, then two theories are ontologically distinct.

**Argument 3: Catching Metaphysical Cheaters**

- In the philosophy of time, presentists may cheat to say "There was dinosaurs" have no truthmaker

#### 2.2.2 Two Varieties of Truthmaker Theory


**Variety 1: Truthmaker Maximalism**

: Every truth has a truthmaker

- **Problem 1**: Negative existentials
	1. What kind of thing would, once exist, guarantee that "there are no golden mountains"? Suppose there is such truthmaker, then the non-existent of some truthmakers will entail the existence of some other truthmakers. Then we must accept the necessary relationship between these truthmakers as brute. 
	2. In addition, whenever some contingent thing fails to exist, there is a distinct contingent thing that is guaranteed to exist. 
	3. Also, it would lead to the fact that exactly half of all contingent things exist.
	- Given these points, this view seems weird
- **Problem 2**: Universal generalizations
	- The truthmaker of "all dogs are mammals"(understood as a necessary statement) is the same as "x is either non-dog or x is a mammal", which only guarantees that actual dogs are mammals. It does not exclude the possibility of there being a non-mammal.
	- **Tentative solution**: totality fact guarantees that there's nothing exists other than the things that actually exists.
		- **Objection**: You will run into the same problem of negative existentials
- **Problem 3**: Conjunctions and Fundamentality
	- The conjunction of $A \land B$ needs a separate truthmaker, other than the truthmaker of $A$ and the truthmaker of $B$. But this seems to be an overkill because the conjuncts seem to be more fundamental than the conjunction. 

Variety 2: Atomic Truthmaker Theory

~ The only truths that have unique truthmakers are a special class of truth, the atomic truths; Atomic truths are simple and positive;
~ A conjunction is true iff the truthmakers of its conjuncts exits;
~ A negative statement is true iff it *lacks* a truthmaker

**Features**: 

1. **Supervenience**: All truth weakly supervenes on the atomic truths (both true and false)
2. Given that it is a weakened version of correspondence theory, we need to check if it preserve the nice properties a traditional correspondence would have:
	1. **From Correspondence to Truthmakers**: YES. Since there is still a weak supervenience, the correspondence relationship between proposition and the world still holds
	2. **Distinguishing Theories**: YES.
	3. **Catching Cheaters**: NO. Atomic truthmaker theory allows for truth without truthmakers. Therefore it cannot always catch cheaters, since they also cheat about, e.g. negative existentials. They cannot even catch cheaters by weakly supervenience on the atomic truths. This is because atomic truth include negative propositions.
3. **Fundamentality**: ATT can identity the fundamental truths, i.e. the atomic truths.

### 2.3 Deflationism

Deny that being true is a property. To say that "P is true" is just to say that P

**Objection 1 (Truth as constitutive of belief)**: Belief aims at truth. If truth is not a thing, when what are we doing?

**Objection 2 (Truth as the methodology of science)**: We want science to deliver truth

**Objection 3 (Truth as necessary for epistemology)**: We seems to grasp facts about the property of being true (i.e. laws of truth, like the law of non-contradiction)

### 2.4 Truth Supervenes on Being

The classical truthmaker theory claims that, as long as the truthmaker exits, the proposition is guaranteed to be true. But for truth supervenes on being, "The snow is white" is not truth just because snow exists. Therefore, there is *truthmaking*, but no *truthmakers*. The non-classical account claims that, things must *exist* and *be certain ways* in order to make propositions true.

**Truth Supervenes on Being (TSB)**

- From Lewis 2001;
- The set of all truths weakly supervenes on which things (do and don't) exist and what *fundamental* properties they have (and don't have) and what *fundamental* relations they stand in (and don't stand in)

**Determinables vs. Determinates**: determinable properties have different varieties, while the determinate properties are the varieties. For example, being blue is a determinable, and being navy/royal blue are determinates. 

**Features**:

1. **Explaining determinables-determinate relation**: Classical Truthmaker Account have to construe the determinates necessarily entails determinables as brute necessity. But TSB account explains this.
2. **Fundamentality**: NO. The notion of fundamentality is hardwired into the definition. Therefore it cannot be used to discern the fundamental truths. 
3. **From Correspondence to Truthmakers**: YES. One can understand correspondence in terms of supervenience.
4. **Distinguishing Theories**: YES.
5. **Catching Cheaters**: NO. Same as ATT.
