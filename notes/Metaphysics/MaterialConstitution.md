## 1. The Puzzles

**The Debtor's Paradox**: When you add a pebble to a collection of pebble, you will get a different collection of pebble. Then when there's material constitution changed, I am another person.

**The Puzzle of Dion and Theon**: Theon is Dion without his right foot. Suppose Dion's right foot is removed, it seems Theon survived but not Dion.

**The Ship of Theseus Puzzle**: The ship parts are gradually changed, and in the end everything was changed. And all the gradually removed parts were collected and built into a new ship. Then which is identical to the original new ship?

**The Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay**: On Monday there is a lump of clay and let's name it "Lump". On Tuesday it was built into a statue and let's name it "David". Then we encounter the following problem: Intuitively, David and Lump are just one and the same object. But the following argument shows otherwise:

1. David did not exist on Monday (though existed on Tuesday)
2. Lump existed on Monday (and Tuesday)
3. Leibniz's law: If $a=b$, then $P(a) \leftrightarrow P(b)$
4. Therefore, David is not Lump

**Possible strategies**:

(A). Accept 4 and reject the intuition that David is Lump (the constitution view and the temporal parts theory)
(B). Reject 4 and accept the intuition that David is Lump
	(a). Deny 1 (eliminativist)
	(b). Deny 2 (eliminativist, dominant kinds view)
	(c). Deny 3 (relative identity theory)
(C). This is just a verbal dispute

## Strategy A: David is not Lump

### Four problems for strategy (A)

I. **The impenetrability objection**: Material is impenetrable. Therefore you cannot have two physical object at the same space.
II. **The extensionality objection**: If two objects have the same extensionality, then they are the same. Therefore, we should not say that David is not Lump.
III. **The grounding objection**: some properties are grounded on some more basic properties. But if Lump and David are perfect duplicate (in Tuesday), then how could there be any difference at all? What explains the difference?
IV. **The anthropic objection**: Why stop at two (Lump and David)? There are infinitely many exotic objects like in-statue, table-statue, etc.

### Coincident Objects

David Wiggins

If anyone accepts (A), one needs to recognize an asymmetric *constitution relation* which is different from identity. It is also a *dependence relation*: the statue "consists in" and is "nothing over and above" the lump of clay
#### Reply to the four problems

I. **The impenetrability objection**: The statue and the lump of clay SHARE the same parts.
II. **The extensionality objection**:
	(1). Reject extensionality
	(2). Deny that David and Lump share all their material parts
	(3). David and Lump differ in some non-material aspect (e.g. form)
III. **The grounding objection**:
	(1). David and Lump differ in relational properties: David is a statue because it is admired, discussed and reviewed.
		**Problem**: Is David a statue, discussed and reviewed because it is admired, or David is admired, discussed and reviewed because it is a statue? ==Euthyphro problem again?==
	(2). David and Lump differ in historical facts: Lump was created by a clay-maker but David was created by a sculptor
		**Problem**: Gibbard (1975)'s case: an artist creates a statue by making the head and the body separately, and then put them together to create a full statue. Call the new piece of clay Lumpl and the statue Goliath. Now Lumpl and Goliath has all the same historical facts because they are created by the same person.
IV. **The anthropic objection**:
	(1). There are no such exotic objects because of our conceptual scheme.
		**Problem**: Why would our conceptual scheme determine reality?
	(2). There are such exotic objects



### Temporal Parts

David Lewis

Persistence through time is like spreading through space. Material objects exist at different times by having distinct temporal parts at those times. David is a proper temporal part of Lump.

#### Reply to the four problems

I. **The impenetrability objection**: Like two roads can share the same part, two objects can share the same temporal parts
II. **The extensionality objection**: Lump and David do not have the same temporal parts.
	**Problem**: Lumpl and Goliath have the same temporal parts. But Lumpl and Goliath seems to have different modal properties: Lumpl can survive being squashed, but Goliath can't
	**Reply**: "x could survive being squashed" just means "there exists some counterparts of x that survives squashing". Lumpl can survive being squashed because we pick Lumpl-counterparts. Therefore in the case of Lumpl and Goliath they are the same object because "can survive being squashed" expresses different properties for Lumpl and Goliath.
		**Problem**: But there are still non-modal difference. We say Goliath is Romanesque but not Lumpl; We say Lumpl is well-made, but not Goliath
III. **The grounding objection**: Adopt the constitution theory's strategy or they can just say it's because they have different temporal parts. ==Why would they have some property now if they only have different parts in the future==
IV. **The anthropic objection**: Same as the constitution theory's strategy

## Strategy B: David is Lump

### Eliminativism

To deny there's such thing as Lump or David.

#### Unger: mereological nihilism

Only atom exists.

**Problem 1**: How do you give an account of our ordinary way of talking?
	**Reply**: What we mean by "status" is "simples arranged statuewise"

**Problem 2**: This is incompatible with the world being infinitely divisible.

#### Van Inwagen: Only living objects can be composite objects

Only atom and living creature exists.

There is Dion but there's no such person as Theon

**Problem**: it seems vague whether something exists because living creature is vague. But it seems cardinality claims are not vague because first order logic is not vague.

#### Chisholm: mereological essentialism

The doctrine:

- For any $x$ and $y$, if $x$ is a part of $y$, then necessarily if $y$ exists then $x$ is a part of $y$

**Consequence**: A thing cannot change its parts. 

**Problem for the statue-clay problem**: they do not change their parts, but rather shapes.

- **Reply**: adding the following principle: For any $x$ and $y$, if $x$ composes $y$, then necessarily if $x$ exists then $x$ composes $y$; i.e. whenever you have some parts, you get the whole. Therefore, since all parts of David are already there on Monday, David already exists on Monday.

- **Problem 1**: How to give an account of our ordinary talk of identity over time?
- **Reply**: There's only similarity as a "loose sense" of identity.

- **Problem 2**: How could any statue exists before it is built?
- **Reply**: The thing we are now calling statue now did exist before it was built.
