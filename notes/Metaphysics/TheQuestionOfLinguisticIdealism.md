- A word has a *logical shape*, and the sape answer to the essence of the thing it refers to.
- Different words in different languages differ in symbol and sound, but they have the same "*logical shape*"
- The logical shape is the grammar: "equus", "cheval", "horse", "hippos" are all count-noun which is the name of a kind of whole living thing

> Here, what Anscombe means by "logical shape" seems to be semantics, and she is making a suprising claim that all semantics are just syntax. There is probably something right about it. We surely have some idea about the referent of a word. If we have absolutely no idea what a word could possible refer to at all, we then do not understand the meaning of a word.

Does essence come first, and then we develop language to carve up essence; Or we develop lanaguage to carve things up and then say it's essence?
