Thomasson's proof of existence:

1. All noun phrase introduced to a language in a non-fictional way exist
2. If we use 'property' in 'Are there properties' in $\mathscr{L}$, we are using a noun phrase introduced to $\mathscr{L}$ in a non-fictional way
3. Therefore, the answer to 'Are there properties' in $\mathscr{L}$ is simply 'Yes'
