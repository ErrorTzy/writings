## The Puzzles

### The Debtor's Paradox 

When you add a pebble to a collection of pebble, you will get a different collection of pebble. Then when there's material constitution changed, I am another person.

### The Puzzle of Dion and Theon

Theon is Dion without his right foot. Suppose Dion's right foot is removed, it seems Theon survived but not Dion.

### The Ship of Theseus Puzzle

The ship parts are gradually changed, and in the end everything was changed. And all the gradually removed parts were collected and built into a new ship. Then which is identical to the original new ship?

### The Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay

On Monday there is a lump of clay and let's name it "Lump". On Tuesday it was built into a statue and let's name it "David". Then we encounter the following problem: Intuitively, David and Lump are just one and the same object. But the following argument shows otherwise:

1. David did not exist on Monday (though existed on Tuesday)
2. Lump existed on Monday (and Tuesday)
3. Leibniz's law: If $a=b$, then $P(a) \leftrightarrow P(b)$
4. Therefore, David is not Lump

**Possible strategies**:

(A). Accept 4 and reject the intuition that David is Lump (the constitution view and the temporal parts theory)
(B). Reject 4 and accept the intuition that David is Lump
	(a). Deny 1 (eliminativist)
	(b). Deny 2 (eliminativist, dominant kinds view)
	(c). Deny 3 (relative identity theory)
(C). This is just a verbal dispute

## Strategy A: David is not Lump

### Four problems for strategy A

I. **The impenetrability objection**: Material is impenetrable. Therefore you cannot have two physical object at the same space.
II. **The extensionality objection**: If two objects have the same extensionality, then they are the same. Therefore, we should not say that David is not Lump.
III. **The grounding objection**: some properties are grounded on some more basic properties. But if Lump and David are perfect duplicate (in Tuesday), then how could there be any difference at all? What explains the difference?
IV. **The anthropic objection**: Why stop at two (Lump and David)? There are infinitely many exotic objects like in-statue, table-statue, etc.

### Wiggins: Coincident Objects

If anyone accepts (A), one needs to recognize an asymmetric *constitution relation* which is different from identity. It is also a *dependence relation*: the statue "consists in" and is "nothing over and above" the lump of clay
#### Reply to the four problems

I. **The impenetrability objection**: The statue and the lump of clay SHARE the same parts.
II. **The extensionality objection**:
	(1). Reject extensionality
	(2). Deny that David and Lump share all their material parts
	(3). David and Lump differ in some non-material aspect (e.g. form)
III. **The grounding objection**:
	(1). David and Lump differ in relational properties: David is a statue because it is admired, discussed and reviewed.
		**Problem**: Is David a statue, discussed and reviewed because it is admired, or David is admired, discussed and reviewed because it is a statue? ==Euthyphro problem again?==
	(2). David and Lump differ in historical facts: Lump was created by a clay-maker but David was created by a sculptor
		**Problem**: Gibbard (1975)'s case: an artist creates a statue by making the head and the body separately, and then put them together to create a full statue. Call the new piece of clay Lumpl and the statue Goliath. Now Lumpl and Goliath has all the same historical facts because they are created by the same person.
IV. **The anthropic objection**:
	(1). There are no such exotic objects because of our conceptual scheme.
		**Problem**: Why would our conceptual scheme determine reality?
	(2). There are such exotic objects



### Lewis: Temporal Parts

Persistence through time is like spreading through space. Material objects exist at different times by having distinct temporal parts at those times. David is a proper temporal part of Lump.

#### Reply to the four problems

I. **The impenetrability objection**: Like two roads can share the same part, two objects can share the same temporal parts
II. **The extensionality objection**: Lump and David do not have the same temporal parts.
	**Problem**: Lumpl and Goliath have the same temporal parts. But Lumpl and Goliath seems to have different modal properties: Lumpl can survive being squashed, but Goliath can't
	**Reply**: "x could survive being squashed" just means "there exists some counterparts of x that survives squashing". Lumpl can survive being squashed because we pick Lumpl-counterparts. Therefore in the case of Lumpl and Goliath they are the same object because "can survive being squashed" expresses different properties for Lumpl and Goliath.
		**Problem**: But there are still non-modal difference. We say Goliath is Romanesque but not Lumpl; We say Lumpl is well-made, but not Goliath
III. **The grounding objection**: Adopt the constitution theory's strategy or they can just say it's because they have different temporal parts. ==Why would they have some property now if they only have different parts in the future==
IV. **The anthropic objection**: Same as the constitution theory's strategy

## Strategy B: David is Lump

### Eliminativism (deny 1&2)

To deny there's such thing as Lump or David.

#### Unger: mereological nihilism

Only atom exists.

**Problem 1**: How do you give an account of our ordinary way of talking?
	**Reply**: What we mean by "status" is "simples arranged statuewise"

**Problem 2**: This is incompatible with the world being infinitely divisible.

#### Van Inwagen: mereological nihilism + living objects

Only atom and living creature exists.

**Advantage**: Solves the puzzle about personal identity, e.g. There is Dion but there's no such person as Theon

**Problem**: it seems vague whether something exists because living creature is vague. But it seems cardinality claims are not vague because first order logic is not vague.

#### Chisholm: mereological essentialism

**Gist**: Everything exists, but a thing cannot change its parts. 

The doctrine:

- For any $x$ and $y$, if $x$ is a part of $y$, then necessarily if $y$ exists then $x$ is a part of $y$

**Problem for the statue-clay problem**: they do not change their parts, but rather shapes.

- **Reply**: adding the following principle: For any $x$ and $y$, if $x$ composes $y$, then necessarily if $x$ exists then $x$ composes $y$; i.e. whenever you have some parts, you get the whole. Therefore, since all parts of David are already there on Monday, David already exists on Monday.

- **Problem 1**: How to give an account of our ordinary talk of identity over time?
- **Reply**: There's only similarity as a "loose sense" of identity.

- **Problem 2**: How could any statue exists before it is built?
- **Reply**: The thing we are now calling statue now did exist before it was built.

### Burke: Dominant Kinds (deny 2)

Burke assumes the following principle:

- It is possible for an object to be a kind $K$ without having the persistence conditions $P$ associated with $K$

That is to say, David is both a state and a lump, but it does not mean that it has the persistence condition for both statue kind and lump kind. Then what is David's persistence condition? The doctrine of dominant kind is as follows:

- Let $S$ be the set of kinds that an object $O$ belongs to. Object $O$ has the persistence condition $P$ associate with the dominant kind $K \in S$ such that, $\text{O qua K}$ has the widest range of properties. 

Therefore, the persistence condition of David is the statue; the persistence condition of Lump is lump of clay. Let's call the lump of clay in Tuesday LumpT. LumpT is not Lump, since LumpT has the same persistence condition of David's. Therefore, David=LumpT.

**Advantage**: 

- More intuitive than eliminativism: it recognize the existence of ordinary objects; 
- More intuitive than essentialism: an object can persist in time until it acquires a new dominant kind.

**Problem**: 

- **Objection from commonsense**: All you need to do to destroy a rock is to gather a bunch of artists and call it an artwork.
	- **Reply**: We are saying "rocky stuff", and the "rocky stuff" survives through time due to its ambiguity of its kind.
- **Objection from dominance**: Sometimes it is hard to tell which is the dominant kind. Is the dominant kind of a performance artist an artwork or a person?
- **Objection from insufficiency**: It cannot solve the ship of Theseus puzzle.

### Geach: Relative Identity (deny 3)

relative identity denies Leibniz's law: identity is always relative to a kind. There is no absolute identity.

Geach need to accept some relativized Leibniz's law: for some x and y *of the same kind*, if $x=y$ then $Pa \leftrightarrow Pb$ for any $P$

**Problem**:

- Since intuitively Lump (qua clay) is David (qua clay), they would have the same property. But they don't because David did not exist on Monday while Lump does.
	- **Reply**: David and Lump contains kinds. To say Lump existed on Monday is to say "there is an object in kind 'lump of clay' which is identical to Lump". Therefore "David/Lump exists" expresses different properties. ==Then we can just give up the relative identity thesis and qua oneself out.==
- **Objection from Insufficiency**: Intuitively, identity is transitive. But if we admit that, in the Theseus' ship puzzle, the original ship is identical to both ships, then according to the transitivity, the same ship could appear at two different places in the same time. If you deny this, it seems we are not talking about the identity relation.==Is this denial inevitable?==
- **Objection from bad consequence**: The denial of absolute identity has drastic implication in logic, semantics and set theory. For example, they must deny extensionality because it is talking about absolute identity.

## Strategy C: Verbal Dispute

**Clear case of verbal dispute**: two people A and B agreeing on everything else but debating whether a thing is a ship or a boat. Even if according to semantic externalism one person is right, the dispute is still verbal. Let there be a semantics of A-language that makes what A says true, and B-language that makes what B says true. The **ONLY** disagreement is whether English is A-language or B-language, since A and B agree on everything else that are unrelated to ships.

- **Problem**: We do not know clearly what is the disputed item, and what thus what are the alternative candidates.
	- **Reply**: Since Lewis and Unger would disagree on numerical statements which can be reduced purely to logic, they must at least disagree on some logical symbol or constant. The most plausible suggestion is the dispute in quantifiers.
	- **Problem**: For A and B, there are enough common parts of their language such that B could interpret A-ship in B-language such that A would agree using these vocabularies, and vise versa. But since for Unger there's no such thing as ordinary objects, there's no way to interpret Lewis in the way that Lewis would agree.
