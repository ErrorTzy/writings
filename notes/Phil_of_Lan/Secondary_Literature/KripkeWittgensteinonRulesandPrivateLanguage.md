## The Wittgenstein Paradox

**The initial paradox**: Assume we agree on the definition of  '+' as the intended operation that we akways understand. The 'x plus y' is x+y; 'x quus y' is x+y if x and y are less than 57, otherwise it is 5. The problem is: *why do I mean plus and not quus?*

**Two questions**:

1. What is the *fact* that determines I mean plus and not quus.
2. What is the *justification* for me to be confident that I have always meant plus and not quus.
