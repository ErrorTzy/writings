## The Wittgenstein Paradox

**The initial paradox**: Assume we agree on the definition of  '+' as the intended operation that we akways understand. The 'x plus y' is x+y; 'x quus y' is x+y if x and y are less than 57, otherwise it is 5. The problem is: *why do I mean plus and not quus?*

**Two questions**:

1. What is the *fact* that determines I mean plus and not quus in the past.
2. What is the *justification* for me to be confident that I have always meant plus and not quus.

**Quus skepticism vs Indeterminacy of translation**: The latter tries to present the problem of meaning of words in terms of a linguist: what is the right way to guess what *someone else* means by words on the basis of behavior. But here the skeptical challenge is about *myself*: what do *I* meant by 'plus' in the past? The skeptic asserts that, even God cannot determine which function *I* meant.

**Attempt 1**: I know that I meant plus, because "x plus y" means the following operation: Count x number of marbles, and then count y number of marbles. After that, put all the marbles together and count them. The result is x+y.

**Kripke's response:** This operation can be fixed only if you can fix the meaning of 'count'. But we can define the operation of 'quount' which means 'count' if the pile of marbles is less than 57, and yields the anser 5 otherwise. So the problem remains: why do I mean count and not quount?

> Remark: I think this regression reveals the problem of explicability of something. When is something explicable? In a sense, everything that we are aware of is explicable, in the sense that we can use a word to denote it. However, the problem is if we *publicly* fix the meaning of a word. We
