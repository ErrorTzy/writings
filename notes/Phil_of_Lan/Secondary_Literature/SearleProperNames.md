# Is Tully = Cicero analytic?

a. Tully = Tully
b. Tully = Cicero

(a) and (b) are different. (a) is analytic. But is (b) analytic?

**Definition**: 

A statement is analytic iff. it is true in virtue of linguistic rules alone.

## Ans 1: b is analytic. 

**Question:** How can they be analytic? 

(a) and (b) are fundamentally different. Therefore, they cannot be both analytic.
This is because in the sentence 'Tully = Tully', Tully can be arbitrarily replaced.

**Defense:** Language Rules

If I set down a rule that X and Y can be used interchangeably in my writing, then X = Y is also trivially analytic for *those who know the rule*.

### Problem: Bacon = Shakespeare

If someone speaks of Bacon = Shakespeare, he is not saying a rule of English. Even if in some cases it can be analytic, it is sometimes not.

## Ans 2: b is synthetic

**Question:** How can they be synthetic?

We do not ordinarily think of proper names as having a sense because we do not give definitions of proper names.

**Defense:** We learn by sense.

We *teach* a name through its characteristics. Therefore, we identify them by their sense.

### Problem: Pedagogy is irrelevant

Once students has identified the object, he can ignore how he learned it.

#### Refutation: Aristotle is more than the object

1. If a proper name has no sense but only reference, then 'x does not exist' means the name 'x' denotes to nothing. 
2. A man named 'Aristotle' who was born in 1903 would be irrelevant with 'Aristotle does not exist.'
3. Therefore, 'Aristotle does not exist' does *not* mean 'Aristotle is no one's name'.
4. Therefore, it is *false* that a proper name has no sense but only reference.

> Evaluation: 2 does not necessarily follow 3 because it may be irrelevant only due to context.


# Does proper names have sense or reference?

Only reference but no sense vs. Only sense but no reference

> What's the relationship between sense/reference and analytic/synthetic?

Metaphysical implications: Ultimate object vs. Indiscernibles 
Subject - predicate structure supports the first, while how we learn words supports the second

## If only sense, what is it?

If proper name has senses, then odd consequences occur: 

- true statements are analytic, and false statements are self-contradictory;
- the meaning changes with the object
- names have different meaning for different people

> And what's the relationship between sense and meaning?

### Not the name!

The sense of 'This is Aristotle' is *not* 'This object is named Aristotle' because 'named Aristotle' is a universal while Aristotle is a proper name. 
Therefore, for identifying Aristotle 'named Aristotle' is only a necessary but not sufficient condition.

### Searle: It's unspoken!

> Searle's **methodology** is to appeal to use of proper names.
> First, Searle defines proper names by its **use**.
> We use proper names to refer to objects **without** giving any descriptions.
> We do refer them with some unspoken descriptions, 
> but we use proper names to prevent these descriptions from being spoken.
> Therefore, proper names themselves does not include any descriptions
> But they are logically connected with descriptions.
>
> It's like interface in java. The descriptions are the implementations of interfaces.
> Interface requires implementation, but itself does not include implementation.
> Its advantage is to "agree to disagree".
>
>
> Evaluation:
> But what about the user? Does the user specify it at all?
> Because intuitively, it seems sometimes the user does not know the necessary condition of an object being Aristotle.
> But one still can speak of Aristotle.
> It seems that Searle's theory does not need even the speaker to specify any necessary condition.
> It seems only the *epistemic* necessary condition *for the speaker only* is needed. 
>
> In other words, the speaker still use unspoken descriptions to refer to an object.

#### Definite descriptions vs. Proper names

- Proper names do not require context `Why Searle mentions this?`
- Proper names do not need to specify any characteristics

#### How does it have referring power?

Searle's answer: asserting an *unspecified* set of statements to be true

1. If the unspoken descriptions are precisely specified, then proper names are logically equivalent to descriptions.
2. The *pragmatic* purpose of proper names is to publicly referring to objects without raising any issue about its characteristics.
3. Therefore, proper names are not logically equivalent to descriptions.
4. Therefore, the unspoken descriptions are not precisely specified.

Proper names: does not tell anything about what the object is.
Descriptions: saying what the object is, though may not be precise.
