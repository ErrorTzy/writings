# Subject:  to talk about unique referring use

## Analysis of Russellian theory

It seems true that the following proposition is true:

1. "The king of France is bald" is meaningful.
2. If "the king of France" is non-existent and the sentence is talking about it, then the sentence is not meaningful

A possible view is to deny the antecedent of 2, i.e. to admit that "the king of France" in some sense exist, but this should be rejected.

Russell's solution:

Although "the king of France" is the grammatical subject of the sentence, it is not the logical subject of the sentence. Therefore, it is not talking about an entity, but in fact a description.

Russell's reasoning.

1. There is a grammatical subject of a sentence.
2. For any *genuine* subject-predicate sentence, the subject has to refer to something to be meaningful. (Implying that there are *genuine* subject-predicate sentence so that we may be misled by the disguised ones)
3. Therefore, if "king of France" is not "something", then it cannot be the genuine subject.
4. Therefore, despite being grammatical subject, "the king of France is bald" is not subject-predicate at all

1. A subject is genuinely being predicated if and only if it is a logical subject.
2. A name is meaningless unless it has something to designate. That is, the meaning of a name is the object it designate.

Strawson thinks 2 is wrong. And in Strawson's view, there are no logically proper names and descriptions.


## Strawson's theory

There is a distinction between:

1. a sentence/expression
2. a use of a sentence/expression
3. an utterance of a sentence/expression

People can utter a same sentence but use them differently.

Only a sentence *being used by someone* can be about something, and only if it is about something can it have truth value.

Similarly, only an expression *being used by someone* can refer to a person.

Meaning is a set of conventions/rules that direct us to find particular object/truth value.
Mentioning/truth value are functions of the use of sentence and expression. 

## Critique of Russellian theory

Russell thinks:

1. Anyone uttering "the king of France is bald" is making a true assertion
2. Part if what he is asserting is false

But these two statements are false. Russell's analysis is implied, but not entailed.

> Rather, it's the logical rule required to fetch the correct object

Consider "The table is covered with books": "the table" does not have to be unique. It is only implying that there is only one thing being referred to, and it is a table. 

Referring itself cannot be reduced to an assertion because to refer is not to assert that you are referring.

## Ancient Logic Puzzles

Two tasks when stating facts:

1. What are you talking about?
2. What are you saying about it?

To forestall the first question is the referring use; To forestall the second is the attributive use.

A subject is always referring use. 

Referring use use linguistic conventions to find object from context. Attributive use does not seek context, thus referring use is over and above attributive use.
Referring use only imply the convention for referring; Attributive use includes the convention of attribution `why?`

Conventions for referring is neglected because:

1. Philosophers are obsessed with definitions, and definitions are attributive and does not concern the context. If you only care about analysis and meaning, you will neglect problems wider than that.
2. Conventions are facts but philosophers are obsessed with formal logic system. `?`

Difference between expressions capable of referring:

1. how dependent on the context: `How to define context? Does it include knowledge and belief?`
    a. "I", "it" is completely dependent
    b. "The author of Waverley" is completely not dependent
2. how many descriptive meaning does it have:
    a. Proper names have no descriptive meaning
    b. Substantial phrases, like "the round table", have descriptive meaning
3. Is it regulated by language rules, or ad hoc convention for particular use: `?`
    a. Pronouns and substantial phrases are regulated by language rules
    b. Proper names are regulated by ad hoc rules

There are some expressions in between.

## Applications

**Indefinite references:** 

"A man, someone": either the conditions for "the" is not fulfilled, or we want to keep dark the identity

**Identification statements:**

1. This is the man who X
2. This is X

The difference is that, the first is doing an identification between two persons, and the second is a normal subject-predicate use.

**The logic of subjects and predicates:**

Traditional law that presupposes existence and modern law that doesn't?

Ordinary language is not exact logic.
