## I. Preliminaries

### 1.1 Some Further Examples of Indexicals, Some Terminology and a Contrast with Ambiguity

**indexicals**: narrower; simple indexicals
**context-sensitive expressions**: broader; indexicals and expressions built upon indexicals

**indexicality**: single meaning by linguistic convention, and varying referent by context
**ambiguity**: multiple meanings by linguistic convention, like 'bank'

### 1.2 Indexical and non-indexical uses of pronouns

pronouns like "he", "she", "his", "hers" have three uses:
1. **indexicals uses**: He was born in Detroit. [Pointing at John]
2. **bound variable uses**: Every young boy thinks he will go to the school.
3. **unbound anaphoric uses**: Johnny was riding a bike. He was having a good time.

### 1.3 Distinction among Types of Indexicals

Kaplan:
- **Pure indexicals:** do not need demonstration
- **True demonstratives**: need demonstration

Perry:
- **automatic indexicals**: accessible from public contextual facts, like 'I', "tomorrow"
- **discretionary indexicals**: depend on speaker's intention, like 'he', 'she', 'that', 'here', 'now' etc
- **wide context** (including speakers' intention, gesture, etc) VS. **narrow context** (only speaker, time and space)

Notice that when we speak of "now", "here", the range is based on the speaker's intention. Therefore though Kaplan classifies them as pure indexicals, Perry classifies them as discretionary indexicals.

### 1.4 Reference-fixing and content-fixing for true demonstratives

A (narrow) context is incomplete for a true demonstratives. Then *what* is missing?

Candidates: *demonstrations*, and *speaker's intention*

Problem for demonstration theorists: if we take "now", "here" as true demonstratives, then there is no demonstration
Problem for intention theorists: The speaker may have conflicting or wrong intentions

## 2. Which Expressions are indexicals?

Uncontroversial indexicals: pronouns, 'now', 'here', etc
But there are some controversial indexicals

### 2.1 Some expressions that have been said to be indexicals

1. tense markers: "Fred is hungry" means that "Fred be hungry at t"
2. modals: modal operators are like restricted quantifier over possible worlds
3. gradable adjectives: tall, old, fast, etc
4. adjectives and nouns that take complements: neighbor (for x), ready (for x)
5. know: different content in different contexts
6. quantifier: quantifier-domain restriction
7. ...and nearly all expressions in natural languages

If these expressions are indexicals, then intention theory is preferred over demonstration theory. 

### 2.2 Strict contextualism, invariantism with hidden indexicals, and invariantism with unarticulated constituents

The semantics of "x is rich":
- **Strict contextualism**: R(x), while the function R is sensitive to context
- **Invariantism with hidden indexicals**: R(x, y), there is a hidden y sensitive to context; R invariably means "rich for"
- **Invariantism with hidden constituents**: "x is rich" s not fully propositional (Perry 2000, Ch. 10)

### 2.3 Strategies for resisting attributions of context-sensitivity

**Appeal to pragmatics**: "Every student have a pencil" just means "Every student in the universe have a pencil", except the speaker conveys a different meaning other than the content of the sentence.
**Appeal to relativism**: The 'might' in "Susan might be in Boston" has the same content in all context, but the truth value changes for different individuals/bodies of knowledge.

### 2.4 Proposed Test for Indexicality

S is sensitive to context iff it is possible for there to be 

1. two speakers who utter $S$ (at the same time) and say different things, or
2. a speaker utters $S$, and a speaker utters $\neg S$, but they do not contradict each other

These tests might be rejected. For example, two speakers may say different things due to pragmatics. The content remains invariable.

**Disquotation test**:

S is sensitive to context iff it is possible that:

1. A utters S, yet
2. "A says that S" is false in some context

For example, Smith says "I am hungry", but John says "Smith says I am hungry" can be false because 'I' refers to John now. But this test is controversial.

## 3. Kaplan's Theory of Indexicals

### 3.1 An example (again) and Kaplan's distinctions

Motivation of the theory:

- Mary: "I am a philosopher"
- John: "I am a philosopher"

They said the same thing but expressed different things. How? Kaplan proposed a distinction between two kinds of meaning, *character* and *content*

### 3.2-3.8 Kaplan's Theory

indexicals have content with respect to at least agent, time, location and possible world

The content of a sentence = structured proposition, consist of content of the words in S
circumstance of evaluation = <time, possible world>
given the sentence and context, the content is determined
given the content and circumstance, the truth value is determined
Therefore, the sentence is *doubly relativized* to both context and circumstance(world). This is often called *double indexing*
The $world_{context}$ and the $world_{circumstance}$ are different under modal operators.
content is fixed by context, referent is fixed by context and circumstance(world)

Kaplan's theory does not address utterance/speech act, but can have some implications

### 3.9 Some Criticism of Kaplan's theory

Criticism from Lewis: 
what is "what is said"? there are two ways of understanding it:
1. Kaplan's approach: It changes from one to another, depending on the context. Their truth value is then depending on the content and circumstance
2. Another approach: the semantics is fixed with a context and a circumstance. The truth value in turn is determined by semantics alone

Criticism from Salmon: In Kaplan's theory, propositions are not eternal

Criticism from Bach: The only indexicals are the pure indexicals. When people utter things like "that", the sentence is incomplete, but they asserts a full proposition.

Criticism from Braun: The function that represents character misrepresent character

Answering machine puzzle

## 4. Indexical Belief and Indexical Semantics

*Indexical beliefs* are beliefs that agents that would express with sentence that includes indexicals. E.g. "I am a philosopher"

Perry: 
self-locating belief (about 'I', 'here', 'now')

Lewis: 
de-se belief: belief about oneself
de nunc belief: belief about now

Some believe that indexical beliefs are de re beliefs, i.e. the content of belief includes objects

If a speaker have a indexical belief but do not have the belief that contains the proposition pbrary 
arsed by the indexical semantics, then it is a *prima facie* reason for rejecting the semantics.

### 4.1 Direct Reference Theories of indexicals, singular propositions and indexical belief

According to Kaplan, indexicals are directly referential, i.e. their content is the object itself, and they are singular propositions(propositions that have individuals as constituents)
Then '*He is making a mess*' does not differ in content with *'I am making a mess*'. But I do not necessarily believe he latter even if I have the former belief.

### 4.2 A descriptivist theory of indexicals and indexical belief

This somewhat resembles Frege's puzzle. Therefore, it is easy to appeal to "sense" for indexicals.

Problem for this account:
1. If the description is quite complicated, then this is probably not what is on John's mind
2. the thing that description refers to exists seems to be a contingent truth

### 4.3 Direct Reference Responses to Arguments against Their views

Belief is a binary relation between agents and propositions, mediated by a third entity(e.g. character, role, belief state) (Like an assertion is a binary relation between agents and propositions mediated by sentences). In other words, agents can believe a proposition and its negation in different ways without contradicting themselves.

Problem: sometimes the believer does not utter anything

Solution: Perry distinguishes proposition and belief state. A believer can have multiple belief states for one single proposition. And later Perry developed a more complicated view on this.

### 4.4 Lewis and Chisholm on indexical belief

Lewis and Chisholm: agents believe *properties*, not *propositions*.(their difference lies in their ontological commitment) Lewis' variant seems more popular.

Lewis: belief is ascribing property to oneself. If someone believes that "some dogs are brown", then he thinks he has the property of some dogs are brown ==???This is crazy==
Property here means sets of possible objects; To believe a property P means to believe the set of centered worlds <o,w> such that o has P in w (o=object, w=world) ==and the object is the anchor of the centered worlds? And this is still crazy==

A sees B being hungry --> A ascribe himself the property of seeing someone and he is hungry.

The sufficient condition of having a *de re* believe: believing a property that uniquely determines an object under an acquaintance relation
De re belief is not a real belief for lewis ==?==

But they do not extend their views on indexical belief to the semantics of indexicals; They do not claim that the content of an indexical is a property.

Problem with Lewis' account: belief have truth value
Response: Truth is adverbial; to say someone believe something that is true is to say someone believe something truly.

Problem: whenever an agent have a belief other than himself, he seems to need a property, i.e. a description, to locate the object. Then this is a descriptive account

### 4.5 Other Views of Indexical belief (and indexical Semantics)

Frege: a special sense for 'I' that no other agent can grasp
Schiffer: similar to Lewis, believes other than de se will be reduced to some description
Evans: belief includes linguistic character of indexicals

## 5. Other Topics Concerning Indexicals

### 5.1 Quasi-Indicators and Attitude Ascription that Seemingly Attribute First-Person Indexical Attitudes

Reflexive pronouns also seems to have the "first-person ascription" trait. Consider:

1. John believed that he was making a mess, and
2. John believed that he *himself* was making a mess

1 is true but 2 is false. Therefore indexicals like "he himself" and "she herself" can indicate de se belief

Perry's objection: it merely suggests but does not semantically require a de se belief.

Other expressions that seems to suggest a first-person attitude

1. John wants him[pointing to John in the mirror, not knowing it's himself] to eat a slice of pizza
2. John wants to eat a slice of pizza

### 5.2 Complex demonstratives

Examples: that N, this N (N is a noun phrase, like that red car, this woman who is wearing a blue coat)
Are they singular terms (refer to individuals) or quantifier phrases (refer to sets)?

minimal theory, intermediate theory and maximal theory

### 5.3 Multiple Occurrences of Demonstratives

Example: That is not identical with that

if the linguistic rule of 'that' and the context determines the content, then these two 'that' must have the same content ==where's the demonstration?==

Kaplan's Response: the two that have different linguistic rules

There are other responses
