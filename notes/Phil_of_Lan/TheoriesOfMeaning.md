## 1. Two kinds of theory of meaning

**Semantics**: how are symbols connecting to which metaphysical entities, and in what ways
**Metasemantics**: how the connections between symbols and metaphysical objects are established

## 2. Semantic theories

Why there is such a thing as semantics?

**Motivation**: How do we understand sentences we have never heard of?

**Frege's answer**: It's because we understand (1) *the meaning of words* out of which the sentence is built; and (2) we understand *the way the words are arranged* in the new sentence

Therefore, according to Frege, a theory of semantics should investigate how the meaning of a sentence derive from (1) the meaning of words and (2) the way the words are arranged.

Classical semantic theories: 

1. Sentences are (typically) true or false
2. The truth or falsity depends on the information the sentence encodes
3. The information the sentence encodes is determined by the meaning of the parts of the sentence, and the context

### 2.1 Classical Semantic Theories

#### 2.1.1 The theory of reference

A theory of reference is a theory that finds out the metaphysical entity that contributes to the truth condition of the sentence in which these words occur.

**Motivation**: The difference in the following two sentences *can be explained* by the difference in reference of names

(@) Obama was the 44th President of the United States
(@) McGain was the 44th President of the United States

Names refer to objects, and Obama and McGain are different objects *explains* why there is a difference in the truth value.

> When we say "objects", are we saying anything else, other than "whatever things that names can refer to?"

By the same token, the difference of truth value of the following two sentences *can be explained* by the difference in reference of predicates

(@) Obama is a Democrat
(@) Obama is a Republican

In the same spirit, "being a Democrat" and "being a Republican" refers to different functions from object to truth value *explains* why the sentences have different truth values

> Is this really an explanation? When we say the two predicates are different functions that output different truth value when giving the input "Obama", aren't we just repeating the explanadum that they have different truth values?

#### 2.1.2 Theories of reference vs. semantic theories

Reference does not capture what we *mean* by an expression. Consider belief statements:

(@MiM) John believes that the morning star is the morning star
(@EiM) John believes that the evening star is the morning star

The truth value of (@MiM) and (@EiM) could be different, but "the morning star" and "the evening star" refer to the same object.
