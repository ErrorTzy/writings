# Peculiar First Person Phenomenon

**Descartes says, "it is possible that I am not Descartes"**

I can conceive that I am not Descartes, but I cannot conceive that I am not.

*Objection:* It doesn't make sense in the third perspective, for it just mean 'Descartes is not Descartes'

*Response:* Third person perspective is referentially transparent. First person perspective is referentially opaque. We can see that 'I' gives the object differently from 'Descartes' by moving our perspective to Descartes' first person perspective.

> 3. (Proper names are rigid designators) 'I' and 'Descartes' are two metaphysically different objects

So if 'I' does not work like proper names, what is it?

# Defining I

Let's try define it with reflexives:

**Definition of ordinary reflexive:** A word specifies *for hearers* an object designated by the subject of the sentence

`Why?`

**Def 1:** 'I' is the word each person P uses in speaking of oneself

*Objection:* 

There exists such word W that: 

1. Each person P intend to use W to speak of an object O, and 
2. unbeknownst to the person P, the object O is the speaker P.

'I' is not W because P necessarily knows that O is identical with P.

So if the definition does not rule out W, then the definition fails; 

So when P uses W, does it count as "P speaking of oneself"?

If we understand "oneself" as the ordinary reflexive, then 'oneself' here is something that can specifies object P *for hearers*. 

But W indeed can specify object P *for hearers*, though the speakers do not intend to do so.

Therefore, W fits the definition, making the definition fail.

> Remark:
>
> Is this how ordinary reflexive work? Can you think of a scenario where the speaker do not know they are the subject in the third person perspective?


**Def 2:** I = "the word each one uses in speaking of oneself knowingly and intentionally"

*Attack:* This won't do because when P use W, P is also knowingly using W.
*Defense:* But you cannot replace W with P's name and still keep the intention the same. P did not knowingly use W to refer P, but O.
*Attack:* If you understand 'oneself' in the definition as ordinary use, then it cannot entail in what way (i.e. knowingly and intentionally) one specify the object to the hearers. It directly refers to the *object* P, but we want the definition to say "each person P uses in speaking of the *speaker* knowingly and intentionally". So when P uses W, P is specifying *the object that is P for the hearers* knowingly and intentionally.

1. P is speaking of an object QUA W knowingly and intentionally, and 
2. this object is P for the hearers.
3. Therefore, P is speaking of oneself knowingly and intentionally.




First pass: language rules (global rules) --> 'I' gets its referent here
Second pass: conventions (local rules) --> Proper names gets its referent here

The feature of I: it seems syntactical that 
1. it gives an object, and
2. the object that it gives is identical with the speaker
such that when one use it, one cannot not know 2.
