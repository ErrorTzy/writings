# Peculiar First Person Phenomenon

Consider: Descartes says "I(myself) is not Descartes"

**From third person,** "the sense is transparent to us"

The indexical "I" will be traced to "Descartes", then it would be not only possible but also necessary.

(Something (not) interesting happens when personal identity is lost the speaker still persist. Consider Trump's memory and character is swapped to Descartes' body. He may shout "I am not Descartes!" 

If "Descartes" is rigid, it will goes to the thing that is in Trump's body. Then it is true.)

**From first person,** "Assemble the sentence to from different senses"

> It seems plausible, because:
>
> 1. Descartes is stipulated. It is possible that I am never stipulated as "Descartes". The stipulation does not come from syntax, but from language users. 
> 2. Descartes, if understood as descriptive (have such and such relationship and properties), will be different from "I" in its sense.

# Defining I:

(trying to get the sense of 'I'? The mechanism of 'I'? The referent of 'I')

**Def 1:** I = "the word each one uses in speaking of oneself"

Anscombe: To define I with "oneself", 

1. If understood as ordinary reflexive, then it will be different from 'I' when someone do not know "oneself" refers to him (how?)
2. If understood as indirect reflexive, then it is circular

> Ordinary reflexive: refers to the subject of the sentence, so that it can be defined in the third person perspective? Indexical?
> Indirect reflexive: refers to the speaker himself, so that it can only be defined in the first person perspective? "Reflexical"?

**Def 2:** I = "the word each one uses in speaking of oneself knowingly and intentionally"

> Premise: Proper names should be excluded from this definition because one can use this to refer to oneself without knowing any proper names.

*Attack:* Proper names also fit into this definition, but proper names are not 'I'
*Defense:* Proper names are excluded because "speaking of proper names that refers to oneself" is not "speaking of oneself." `i.e. There is a difference between the intention of proper names and reflexive pronouns`
*Attack:* Why there is a difference between "speaking of proper names that refers to oneself" and "speaking of oneself"? 

1. If we understand reflexive as referring to the subject (i.e. the ordinary reflexive), then consider the sentence: Smith realizes the identity between the object he calls "Smith" and himself:
    a. This sentence intuitively displays the difference between proper names and reflexive pronouns/first person perspective.
    b. If replace himself with subject and it does not changes the meaning, then the ordinary reflexive can be used to in the definition to express the correct meaning
    c. But the meaning changes. It becomes the identity between two `anonymous?` referent, one by subject, one by proper name. But this is not the identity we want.
    d. The perfect reflexive we want should show the self-referring nature directly, instead of pointing to a `unknown? non-reflexing?` subject.
2. If we understand reflexive as indirect/perfect, then it must be defined by I.`you mean, in first person perspective?`


The defense will be successful only if reflexive pronouns itself are sufficient indication of the way the object is specified. `i.e. proper names itself do not `

So can reflexive pronouns itself specify an object? 

First pass: language rules (global rules) --> 'I' gets its referent here
Second pass: conventions (local rules) --> Proper names gets its referent here
