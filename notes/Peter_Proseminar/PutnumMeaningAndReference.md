Intro
Are meanings in the head
A socialinguistic hypothesis
Indexicality and rigidity

###### Overview
Overall, the move that Putnam wants to make is that, natural kind term, like water, is defined not just by its superficial properties that everyone uses to identify water. Instead, it is defined by the underlying structure that explains the superficial properties of "water".

How did he do that? So first he argues that we cannot use superficial properties to sufficiently define water because it cannot fix the thing that we've been talking about in our linguistic community.

Then he proposed another way of defining meaning for natural terms, which includes a so-called "same-L" relationship that links to the linguistic community, which behaves like indexicals. And there are some philosophical consequences following from this framework. Like the rigidity of natural kind, conceivability vs. metaphysical possibility and something about social linguistics.

###### Remark on social linguistics
there are two sense in which the extension is determined socially.
If there is some experts that know how to tell the difference, then we rely on them to determine the extension.
If there is no expert and it is a natural kind, which means that it has one underlying structure, then there is an implicit convention in our linguistic community that helps us determine.

###### Intro
Putnam wants prove that, we must deny one of the two generally assumptions, namely

1. For any term, someone knows the meaning of it if and only if they are in a certain psychological state.
2. For any term, the meaning of it determines its extension (there can be no change of extension without changing the intension)

He proves this by giving three instances to show that we cannot say that water is defined by its superficial properties because it cannot fix what we have been talking about when we use the word water.

Then since we intuitively think the content in our head contributes to the fixation of extension, then the picture must be that, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">what's in our head</mark> *plus* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">something that is not in our head</mark> is going to sufficiently determine the extension.

Putnam thinks that the thing that is not in our head is in the linguistic community. What I regard as something, say, water, does not depend on me, but depend on if it bears some relation "$same_L$" with what others regard as water.

**Remark:** 
There is something slippery about the formulation of assumption (1). If the meaning is external, then I can still know the meaning after investigating what others are thinking; And by doing so I fully know the meaning of a certain word. When I do this, I am in a certain psychological state. 
We should just say that there is something in the semantics of a word links to the external world, like the behavior of indexicals.
