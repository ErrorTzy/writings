In Two Dogmas of Empiricism, Quine argues that there is no distinction between synthetic and analytic statements.

In the section "Sementic Rules," Quine argues that we can indeed say that for a language L, there is a set of sentences that are true semantically. 

We can all agree that there is a distinction between English and Chinese. Let's call the feature of English "Englishness." For example, for something to be English, it must be fully constructed out of English alphabet. There would be some vagueness in the exact set of rules that count as "Englishness," but this is not a problem here. The point is, Quine is requiring us to explain why this set of rules can give an account of Englishness. If we cannot in anyway explain Englishness, then the distinction between English and Chinese is a mere belief that should not be adopted by empiricists.

I believe the key problem here is that, Quine do not think we can find an empirical way to give an account of Englishness.
