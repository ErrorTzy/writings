# Did Strawson knock down the no-ownership view?

Strawson claim to have refuted no-ownership view of person in his *Persons*. In this paper, I first introduce how Strawson constructs and refutes it. Then I try to show that his refutation is flawed.

## The No-ownership View
 
In everyday language, we ascribe experience to something that has physical properties, i.e., a body. Strawson asks if we can account for this intuition. He then constructs a possible answer, the no-ownership view of self, only to refute it. According to Strawson, the no-ownership view purports that:

- There is no such thing as an ontological person (i.e., ego), but
- There is such a thing as a psychological (illusory) person.

According to this view, this everyday language phenomenon needs to be explained psychologically, not ontologically. Strawson then goes on to construct a psychological mechanism for how this illusion comes into being: First, some experiences are causally connected to a physical body. Therefore, they are ascribed to one particular body. Because this body is numerically one, it gives rise to a sense of unity. We then proceed to think that the experiences are ascribed to themselves, not to the body. For the two kinds of unity:

1. my experiences are united in, and thus ascribed to this particular body,
2. my experiences are united in, and thus ascribed to themselves (i.e. ego).

(1) is how things are because of the causal connection. However, (2) is not equal to (1) because (1) is contingent, while (2) is a priori (since everything is united in itself). Therefore, (2) is merely illusory and not real, unless otherwise proved.

## Strawson's Objection

Strawson objects that the whole mechanism is not coherent because (1) is actually not contingent. This is because we cannot properly define "my experience". Since the no-ownership view rejects the ontological person, it has to denote something else. But

3. if "my experience" means "all experience", then it would simply be wrong because there are other person's experience.
4. if "my experience" means "all experience contingently dependent on this body", then (1) will be an a priori truth.

Since Strawson thinks there cannot be other good move here, therefore it is necessary that the experiences attributed to the body cannot be attributed to others. As a result, the whole no-ownership view collapses.

## Possible Defense

However, I believe there are at least two ways to defend the no-ownership view against this objection. First, there is an ambiguity in (4). Consider the proposition:

5. All experiences contingently dependent on this body are ascribed to this body.

This statement has both a de dicto and a de re reading of the subject. For example:

6. The current US president works for the US government.

This statement seems a priori true, but only if the speaker is using "the current US president" descriptively. If the speaker is using it referentially, i.e., to denote Joe Biden, then it's possible that Joe Biden lost the last election and is not working for the US government now. Similarly, in (5), there can be a sense in which it is indeed contingent.

Another possible defense is to acknowledge (4), but deny that it is necessary that the experiences attributed to the body cannot be attributed to others. This is because the relationship between the body and the experiences is contingent. Therefore, while the ascription process may be necessary, the causal relation is not. Consequently, it could have been otherwise.
