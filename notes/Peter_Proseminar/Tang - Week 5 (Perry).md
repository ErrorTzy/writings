# Explanation of 'I' in traditional belief

In _The Problem of the Essential Indexical_, Perry criticizes the traditional account of belief, arguing that it fails to explain indexicals. I contend that the concept of 'speaker' can still function as an explanation of 'I' within the traditional framework, avoiding Perry's critique.

## Perry's argument

Perry describes the traditional way of thinking about belief with three doctrines:

1. Belief is a relation between a person and a proposition.
2. Propositions have truth values that do not change through time or from person to person.
3. Propositions must be understood in some "fine-grained" way, e.g., sense, words, etc.

He then argues that this approach fails to explain indexicals. For example, the sentence "I am making a mess" is only true for a particular speaker. Therefore, it violates (2) unless 'I' is explained as a shortcut for some concept $x$ that only 'I' fits. 

If $x$ is a shortcut for 'I,' then it must have the same intension as 'I.' That is to say, 'I' and $x$ are interchangeable in a referentially opaque context, like "I believe that ...". And for any $x$ that can be interchangeable with $y$ in the context of "$z$ believes that $F(y)$", the following two conditions need to be satisfied, i.e.

4. $z$ believes that $x$ is $y$, and
5. For any F, it is necessary that $F(x) \iff F(y)$

But Perry claims that there exists no such $x$ that satisfies this two conditions when y is 'I.' (4) cannot be satisfied because we cannot find such an $x$ without using the concept of 'I'. (5) also cannot be satisfied. It is possible that $z$ falsely believes that $x$ is $I$, and therefore $F(x)$ can be false. But in this case $F(I)$ can still be true. Therefore, it is possible that $F(x)$ and $F(y)$ have different truth value, making (5) false.

In addition, Perry argues that, if 'I' is a shortcut, then it implies that

6. One need to have some concept $x$ that uniquely fits oneself in order to use 'I'

But Perry believes this is not how we use 'I.' Given that conditions (4), (5), and (6) cannot be satisfied, the "shortcut account" fails.

## Response

### Two Uses of 'I'

In response to Perry, I will first address (6). I argue that there are two uses of 'I', one of which indeed has no need for any concept $x$, and does not satisfy (6). However, this use of 'I' does not need to be taken into consideration. Another use of 'I' must have a concept of 'the speaker' that uniquely fits 'I'. Then I will argue that the concept of "the speaker" satisfies (4) and (5).

Let's distinguish between two uses of 'I' in language. The first is what we might call *the dummy use* of 'I'.

Imagine you're in a dark room, and you stub your toe. You might exclaim, "Ouch! I feel pain!" In this case, you're not really emphasizing yourself as the subject of the pain. You're simply reporting a sensation. It's similar to saying "There is pain" or "Pain is happening." This dummy use of 'I' is similar to the use of "it" in "It's raining." 

That is to say, the dummy use of 'I' does not require the user to be self-conscious when they use 'I'. Instead, it can be seen as a habit of speaking complete sentence when reporting events. For example, computer programs generate log messages like "Initiating download." But if we force the program to use complete sentence, then it would just print "I am initiating download" to the log. For the purpose of logging, nothing changed.

The second use of 'I', which we might call *the substantial use* of 'I,' emphasizes the subject-predicate structure. This occurs when we explicitly identify ourselves as the subject of an experience or action. For example, if someone asks, 'Who is in pain?' and you respond, 'It's me! I am in pain!', you're doing more than just reporting a sensation. You're consciously attributing that experience to yourself as the subject.

I believe the major difference between the dummy use and the substantial use is that, the dummy use is merely habitual and I do not form any concept about 'I' in my mind. The substantial use, on the other hand, first form some concept of 'I' and ascribe something to it. When Perry asks how my belief that I am making a mess explains my change of action, he's referring only to the substantial use. In Perry's story, 'I am making a mess' expresses the realization 'Oh! It's me! I'm the one making a mess!' rather than simply logging one's own behavior. Therefore, (6) is restricted to the substantial use.

### The Speaker

Then does there need to be a concept that uniquely satisfies oneself when someone uses 'I' substantially? I believe there does need to be such a concept, namely 'the speaker'. This is because 'the speaker' is a concept that one must use to engage in any language at all.

Consider the following scenario: When Earth had just formed as a planet, its temperature was still extremely high. Only a very thin layer on the surface had cooled down and solidified, while beneath it remained in a molten state. Due to the movement of the magma, the cooled surface would be torn apart, forming cracks. Now, imagine if these cracks happened to form the shape of the phrase "I am Donald Trump." Could this be considered evidence that "language already existed when Earth was first formed"?

For anyone with common sense, this cannot count as such evidence. This is because the cracks on the surface *imitate* language, but *are not* language. For shape or sound to be language, it must be produced by a conscious speaker *using words* to present the relevant mind state. Similarly, when a parakeet says "I am Donald Trump", we do not think it speaks English. We think it imitates the sound of English. But this does not stop people from looking up the dictionary and forming an understanding that some MAGA guy is here. But this is merely a false inference because only language expresses meaning, and what was shown by the cracks or said by the parakeet does not belong to language at all. To repeat, for any actual symbol to be a word in language, it is necessary that there exists a speaker, and the speaker has some mind state, and the speaker causes some utterance/string to come into existence. (These requirements are metaphysical requirements, not epistemological requirements. Therefore one can have dummy use of 'I' without having the concept of these requirements.)

Therefore I propose that, whenever someone uses 'I' substantially, they must consciously use the concept of 'the speaker', i.e. 'the cause of this sentence', when they formulate a sentence. Then does 'the speaker' satisfy (4) and (5)?

For (4), I find it inconceivable that someone could say P and simultaneously believe they are not the speaker of P. Even if someone were hypnotized into believing they were responsible for others' sentences, their self-conception would inevitably change. For instance, if I were speaking in front of you, and you were hypnotized to believe that you caused my utterance, you would also begin to believe that my mouth was somehow a part of you.

And the concept of 'the speaker' escapes Perry's attack on (5). How can one have false believe about themselves being the speaker of their own sentences? And if one cannot have such false belief, then Perry's objection to (5) does not hold. Therefore I believe (4) and (5) are satisfied.

Though I argue that 'the speaker' satisfies (4), (5) and (6), some may object that it does not give an account for personal identity. We all think 'I' is something that persists throughout time. But sentences change. How do we know if the speaker of the last sentence is still the speaker of this sentence?

I believe a complete answer would be too long, and I’m running out of space. In short, I think the concept of 'the speaker' is equivalent to 'I' only when we use 'I' in language. However, this doesn’t mean that 'I' is merely the cause of sentences. To fully define the concept of 'I,' rather than simply explaining its use, would require more effort. But for the purpose of addressing Perry's problem regarding indexicals, I believe 'the speaker' is sufficient.
