## Intro

In *Sense and Reference*, Frege seems to have dodged the question of whether fictional names, like "Odysseus," have a referent. He argued that:

> It is a matter of indifference to us whether the name "Odysseus," for instance, has a referent, so long as we accept the poem as a work of art.

In the footnote that follows this quote, he further argues that it is possible for some special terms to have a sense without a referent. However, this answer is in no way satisfying. Whether we are indifferent to it is irrelevant to whether it actually has a referent. Furthermore, the fact that some phrases have no referent does not mean that fictional names also have no referent. In this paper, I argue that fictional names do indeed have referents.

## What is a Referent, Really?

So what exactly do we mean when we say, some phrase has a referent? Given some phrase x, to say "x has a referent" seems to includes two commitments: 

1. There exists such a relationship between x and x's referent, such that x refers to x's referent; and
2. x's referent is a public, objective object that all of us can talk about

Frege suggested that when x refers to its referent, there exists a relationship called "mode of presentation." He used an analogy to illustrate this point:

> Somebody observes the moon through a telescope. I compare the moon itself to the referent; it is the object of the observation, mediated by the real image projected by the object glass in the interior of the telescope, and by the retinal image of the observer. The former I compare to the sense, the latter to the conception or experience. The optical image in the telescope is indeed one-sided and dependent upon the standpoint of observation; but it is still objective, inasmuch as it can be used by several observers. At any rate it could be arranged for several to use it simultaneously. But each one would have his own retinal image. On account of the diverse shapes of the observers' eyes, even a geometrical congruence could hardly be achieved, and a true coincidence would be out of the quest.

This analogy may be metaphysically right. However, this is not enough. For any speaker using x to refer, they must also be aware of (1) and (2). But how do we manage to do this? After all, when we are speaking, all we have in our mind is the conception, not the referent.

Later, when responding to skeptics who asked how you know the moon has any referent, Frege claimed that this must be presupposed to make sense of our act of speaking. This claim appears problematic. If the existence of a referent is presupposed, how can we know we are talking about something that is not merely the mode of presentation of the conception, but the mode of presentation of some object that satisfies (2)?

Therefore, I suggest that, though the "mode of presentation" account may be metaphysically right, but it is not the best explanation for the relationship required by (1). In the following section, I propose the "way of construction" account of sense, and show that it gives a better explanation for (1) and (2) epistemically.

## Peter's shiny forehead

Consider the phrase "The last hair that fell off from Peter's shiny forehead". When we process the phrase, we might form a mental image: some might envision a black hair, others a gray one; some might picture an extremely shiny forehead, others a moderately shiny one. These variations demonstrate the subjective nature of conception.

But how are we managed to construct such a mental image? We already possessed the idea of the concept of blackness, hair, etc.. This phrase did not provide any new atomic concept that we did not now beforehand. What this phrase did provide is how do we put these concept together. In other words, sense can be understood as a set of instructions or a manual for constructing the referent. It's not an objective object like a chair or table. Nevertheless it is objective by following the objective rule of a certain language system.

But what we want to talk about is surely not some private conception to which only we have privileged access. Where does this publicity come from? Frege seems to argue that we must suppose such object exists publicly. But this is unnecessary. Rather, they are logically necessary outcomes from sense. Since sense is the way of construction, then we will get an abstract object of "the result of such construction" because though we may have different way to construct a conception, it is necessary that there is such a result of construction. Since sense, i.e. way of constructing, is objective and public, this abstract object is also objective and public.

We can see that it satisfies the condition of (1) and (2). x and x's referent has the relationship of "way of construction", and this way of construction is defined objectively in language rules. Since language rules are public and objective, the way of construction is objective. And since the way is public and objective, different people can talk about the same thing, i.e. the result of construction. This does not change Frege's metaphysical structure of sense and reference, but offers a better understanding of sense and reference with less presupposition.

## Back to Fictions

Now we can see that, under this account of sense and reference, fictional names do have referents.[^1] There is no problem in constructing fictional objects out of language rules. And sometimes we do discuss the truth value of sentences about fictions. We say it is true that Mickey Mouse is a friend of Minnie Mouse, but we wouldn't consider a sentence like 'Mickey Mouse grew up with Donald Trump' to be true.

Some may worry that, if all referents are merely logical constructions, we will mix fiction with reality. But I do not think it is the responsibility of language alone to distinguish fiction and reality. We verify something to be real by actually seeing and feeling it. Or maybe we are all just brains in vats. In this case, language can hardly help.

[^1]: Some may suggest that proper names are different, since they do not have sense at all -- that is a another huge debate to address, but in short, I find it no problem to construct an object out of a proper name. Anyway let's for the sake of the argument say that proper names also have a sense, i.e. offers a way of construction.
