Frege rejected the correspondence theory of truth with the following argument.

According to Frege, correspondence theory purports that:

    (1). The statement "S is P" is true iff. "S is P" correspond with the fact that S is P.

Frege provided two arguments against this thesis. First, Frege argues that

    (2). (Hidden premise) If (1) is correct, then '"S is P" is true' can be translated to '"S is P" correspond with the fact that S is P'.
    (3). In everyday use of word, "true" is neither a relational verb nor refer to anything else.
    (4). (Hidden premise) "correspond with" is a relational verb.
    (5). (From 3 and 4) '"S is P" is true' has different grammatical struture from '"S is P" correspond with the fact that S is P'
    (6). (From 5) '"S is P" is true' cannot be translated to '"S is P" correspond with the fact that S is P'
    (7). (From 2 and 6) (1) is not correct. 

However, this argument does not really rejects (1) because (2) is wrong. "P iff. Q" does not follow that "P can be translated to Q". The former only requires same truth value, but the latter demands same meaning. For example, "some a is water iff. a is H2O" is true. But if they have the same meaning, then whoever knows the molecule H-O-H will automatically know they are identical with water. But this is not the case. Therefore, they cannot be translated to each other because they have different meaning. At best, Frege's argument does prove is that, the correspondence theory is not a theory of meaning.

An objection could raise that Frege never presupposed (2). Frege is only saying that, the statement '"S is P" is true' has different grammatical structure from '"S is P" corresponds with the fact that S is P'. Then it seems to follow that they have different logical structure. Even we accept this move from grammatical structure to logical structure, still it does not follow that (1) is not correct. For instance, "a is red iff. a produce red light" is true, despite "produce" is a relational verb. (There is some circularity in this definition of redness, but it is sufficient to demonstrate my point here) Again, under this interpretation of Frege, the conclusion is still at best refutes that the correspondence theory can explain the meaning of being true.

Does the correspondence theory of truth have the burden of giving an account for the meaning of truth at all? At least for Frege there should be none. Frege argued that "to be true" is not a property
