# Defending the correspondence theory of truth

Scott Tang



InÂ *The Thought*, Frege refuted the correspondence theory of truth. In This paper, I argue that Frege's refutation is not successful. I end this paper by trying to understand what led Frege dismiss the correspondence theory of truth.

## Frege's objections

According to Frege, correspondence theory purports that:

1. The statement "S is P" is true iff. "S is P" correspond with the fact about S.

Frege provided two arguments against this thesis. First, Frege argues that

2. (Hidden premise) If (1) is correct, then '"S is P" is true' can be translated to '"S is P" correspond with the fact about S'.
3. "Being true" is neither a relational verb nor refer to anything else.
4. (Hidden premise) "correspond with" is a relational verb.
5. (From 3 and 4) '"S is P" is true' has a different grammatical structure from '"S is P" correspond with the fact about S'
6. (From 5) "S is P" is true' has a different logical structure from '"S is P" correspond with the fact about S'
7. (From 6) '"S is P" is true' cannot be translated to '"S is P" correspond with the fact about S'
8. (From 2 and 7) (1) is not correct. 

However, this argument does not really refutes (1) because (2) is wrong. "P iff. Q" does not follow that "P can be translated to Q". The former only requires same truth value, but the latter demands same meaning. For example, "some a is water iff. a is H<sub>2</sub>O" is true. But if they have the same meaning, then whoever knows the molecule H-O-H will automatically know it is water. But this is not the case. Therefore, they cannot be translated to each other because they have different meanings. At best, what Frege's argument does prove is that, the correspondence theory is not a theory of meaning.

An objection could raise that Frege never presupposed (2), and (8) follows directly from (6). But even if we accept the jump from (5) to (6), it is still wrong. For instance, "a is red iff. a produce red light" is true, despite "produce" is a relational verb and the two sentences have different logical structure.[^1] Therefore, (8) cannot directly follow from (6).

Furthermore, (3) is also controversial. "True" can be interpreted as a relational verb if we understand "being true" as a function that accepts two parameters: "S is P" and "the fact about S". In this way, '"S is P" is true' is just an abbreviation. With this interpretation, the correspondence theory can actually be viewed as a theory of meaning. In any case, the first objection does not hold.

Frege's second objection focuses on the ambiguity of the term "correspond." First Frege rejects the notion of "more or less true", therefore "correspond" should be some kind of identity instead of similarity. It follows that, for A to correspond with B, either

- A is identical with B in all aspects, or
- A is identical with B in some certain respect.

In the context of the correspondence theory of truth, A would be a statement and B a fact about the world. Since a statement cannot be perceived by the senses while a fact can, they have different properties and are therefore not identical. Consequently, it is obvious that the first case is not possible.

Then Frege claims that the second case is also not possible. He appears to argue that thoughts and facts are categorically different entities, such that a thought in some respect R and a fact in some respect R cannot be identical, unless identical in some respect, which leads to a regression. In other words, Frege seems to assert that the gap between thoughts and facts is so vast that we cannot bridge them through specified respects. 

However, the plausibility of this argument is unclear. For example, there are three cups on my desk, and I count "one, two, three. Three cups!" Frege should agree that my thought, on the numeric aspect, is identical with the numerical fact about the cups. Therefore I believe Frege's two argument are both flawed.

## What might go wrong?

Later in the paper, Frege argues that, unlike "red" or "magnetic", "being true" is not based on sense perception because "being true" is grammatically predicating sentences, and sentences are actually immaterial thoughts. Since thoughts are not related to sense-impression, "being true" is also detached from sense-impression. Frege later took a detour on explaining what is thought and it appears that he never came back to explain how he define truth. It seems, however, that Frege is suggesting a theory of truth based on how truth came into being, namely asserting. He achieved this conclusion through an analysis of sentences and concepts, which is an a priori approach. This methodology seems to elude some metaphysical aspect about truth. Maybe psychologically comes from our judgement or assertion, and have no much to do with sense impression that represents reality. But it does not entail that thought does not hold corresponding relationship with our physical world.
