Frege rejected the correspondence theory of truth with the following argument.

According to Frege, correspondence theory purports that:

    (1). The statement "S is P" is true iff. "S is P" correspond with the fact that S is P.

Frege provided two arguments against this thesis. First, Frege argues that

    (2). (Hidden premise) If (1) is correct, then '"S is P" is true' can be translated to '"S is P" correspond with the fact that S is P'.
    (3). In everyday use of word, "true" is neither a relational verb nor refer to anything else.
    (4). (Hidden premise) "correspond with" is a relational verb.
    (5). (From 3 and 4) '"S is P" is true' has different grammatical struture from '"S is P" correspond with the fact that S is P'
    (6). (From 5) '"S is P" is true' cannot be translated to '"S is P" correspond with the fact that S is P'
    (7). (From 2 and 6) (1) is not correct. 

However, this argument does not really rejects (1) because (2) is wrong. "P iff. Q" does not entails "P can be translated to Q". The former only requires same truth value, but the latter demands same meaning. For example, "some a is water iff. a is H2O" is true. But it is possible that someone knows "a is water" without knowing "a is H2O". Therefore, they cannot be translated to each other.
