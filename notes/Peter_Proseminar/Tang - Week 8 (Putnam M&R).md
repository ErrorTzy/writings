# Intro

In *Meaning and Reference*, Putnam argues that necessarily water (in our world) is $H_{2}O$. In this paper, I wish to provide a more intuitive alternative to show that it is not necessary.

# Putnam's move

The move that Putnam want to make is that, natural kind term, like water, is defined not just by its superficial properties that everyone uses to identify water. Instead, it is defined by the underlying structure that explains the superficial properties of "water". 

The superficial properties account is wrong for Putnam because the it cannot fix the chemical $H_{2}O$. It is possible that some $XYZ$ also have these superficial properties. But since we have been referring to $H_{2}O$ in our linguistic community, adding into $XYZ$ into the game would change the meaning.

Then what is the right account? Putnam then proposes the meaning of water is that, it bears the $same_L$(the same liquid) relationship with what the linguistic community *here* calls water. But this will not alone allow Putnam to make the move he wants to make. If the $same_L$ is defined as phenomenal sameness, then $XYZ$ and $H_{2}O$ are all water. Therefore, Putnam must specify the criterion of verifying $same_L$ as having the same underlying structure. 

# Is $H_{2}O'$ water?

But what is "underlying structure", exactly? How "underlie" count as "underlying structure"? Probably what's in Putnam's mind is just the molecular structure, since there is such principle in chemistry that molecular properties are determined by structure. For example, $H_2O$ is two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are joined in a specific geometric arrangement through chemical bonds. This principle rests on the assumption that all atoms of a given element are identical.

But assume we will make this discovery in the future: neutrons, rather than being identical particles, exhibit minute variations in their mass and form, following a normal distribution. While the vast majority of neutrons cluster tightly around the mean, making our current chemical models highly accurate at the macroscopic scale, there exist extreme outliers - neutrons with significantly larger or smaller masses.

Now consider an oxygen atom where, by rare chance, all its neutrons are from this extreme heavy tail of the distribution. This oxygen atom could still theoretically form the characteristic bent molecular geometry of $H_2O$ through normal chemical bonding with hydrogen atoms. By definition, molecules formed with this unusual oxygen would still be $H_2O$ -- they maintain the essential $H_2O$ architecture. Let's call this unusual kind of oxygen as $O'$, and this kind of $H_{2}O$ as $H_{2} O'$.

However, the increased mass of the $O'$ nucleus would alter the intermolecular forces. When many $H_{2} O'$ aggregate, these modified intermolecular interactions could produce bulk properties radically different from conventional water, e.g. perhaps manifesting as a sticky, opaque liquid at room temperature rather than the clear, flowing substance we know. Are we going to say that this is also water?

In this example, there are three premises that I made in this example, i.e.

(@oxygen)  $O'$ is a kind of $O$
(@H2O)  $H_{2} O'$ is a kind of $H_{2}O$
(@identity)  Water is $H_{2}O$
(@water)  Therefore, $H_{2} O'$ is a kind of water

If someone denies (@oxygen), then (@H2O) is probably also denied; Similarly, it seems that is someone accepts (@oxygen), then (@H2O) is accepted. One may try to deny (@oxygen) and (@H2O) because $O'$ is not the thing that would explain the ordinary properties of oxygen, and $H_{2}O'$ does not explain the ordinary properties of water. But if we adopt this strategy, it seems we must say that whatever explains the ordinary properties of water count as the underlying structure. Then $XYZ$ will also count as water, and Putnam certainly doesn't want to make this move. Since Putnam want to maintain that (@identity), he must bite the bullet that (@water). 

# The intuitive alternative

But intuitively, ordinary people would more probably deny that this sticky, opaque liquid is water, while maintaining that it would turns out to be a kind of $H_{2}O$. That is to say, there is an intuition to deny (@identity). If your intuition does not follow this claim, imagine the following scenario: Suppose you travel back to 1750 with two samples - one of $XYZ$ and another of $H_{2} O'$ - and present them to the King of England. You begin by showing the $XYZ$ sample to the King.

"Would Your Majesty consider this to be water?" you ask.

"Indeed it is water," says the King, quite confident in his assessment.

You then take out your microscope and demonstrate that $XYZ$ possesses a different molecular structure from $H_{2} O$. Then, through several experiments, you show how $XYZ$ behaves differently from ordinary water under specific conditions.

"I see," the King responds, considering the evidence. "You have shown quite clearly that this is not the water we have been referring to all these years."

Next, you present the $H_{2} O'$ sample - a sticky, opaque liquid - and demonstrate through your microscope that it possesses exactly the same molecular structure as normal $H_{2} O$.

The King examines the evidence carefully before responding: "How curious that this sticky substance shares its structure with water. However, this cannot be water - perhaps we should call it $H_{2} O$ glue, as it better describes its nature."

If this is right, then we may explain that water is not $H_{2}O$ because the word "water" is used in an ordinary context, while "$H_{2}O$" is used in a scientific context. 

This distinction becomes apparent when we consider usage examples. It would sound peculiar to say "I brought a bottle of H₂O to school today" in casual conversation, as the technical term "H₂O" attempts to change it into a scientific context where an ordinary one is expected. However, the same phrase becomes natural when followed by "...for my chemistry experiment," because the scientific context justifies the technical terminology.

Thus, "water" and "H₂O" operate within different linguistic frameworks, each serving distinct communicative purposes. The ordinary term "water" is defined by its everyday function, i.e. its look, smell, taste, etc.. On the other hand, "H₂O" is defined by its scientific function, i.e. chemical structure. There can be some bridging connection that, normally it is okay to switch to one context to another by saying water is $H_{2}O$. But water doesn't have to be $H_{2}O$ necessarily.
