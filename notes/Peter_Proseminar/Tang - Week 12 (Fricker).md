In Epistemic Injustice, Fricker distinguishes innocent mistake from testimonial injustice. In this paper, I wish to show that this distinction is obscure.

What is an innocent mistake? According to Fricker, it is the kind of credibility deficit cased by factors other than prejudice. Fricker illustrates this through an example: imagine a philosopher dismissing a medical faculty member's ethical standpoint, unaware that this person is actually a specialized medical ethicist employed in the medical department. In Fricker's definition, this case doesn't constitute testimonial injustice.

Why this case doesn't count as testimonial injustice? Fricker pushes back on this claim and says, she is just suggesting that we circumscribe the concept in this manner. Fricker says, this is a "very weak sense of injustice", a "mere shadow" of how we use the word 'injustice.' Therefore, it is just a terminology preference and she is just not calling this case testimonial injustice.

## terminology preference?

But what does it mean that calling some action just or unjust is only a terminology preference? What is a "mere terminology preference"? Sometimes people seem to disagree about something, but they're actually just using words differently. This is what we call a terminology problem. When this happens, people are talking about the same thing but using different words to describe it.

For example, there may be a group of people who speak Shmenglish. They're exactly the same as English speakers except for one small difference. In their group, they call that the color red "green," and  the color green "red."

Imagine both groups are looking at the same apple - one that we would call "red." Here's what would happen: Our group would say: "That's a red apple" Their group would say: "That's a green apple"

At first, it sounds like they disagree with us. But they don't. Both groups are seeing the exact same color. They're just using different words to name it. They learned to match the words to colors differently than we did, but their understanding of the colors themselves is exactly the same as ours.

Now let's return to Fricker's example. When Fricker calls these mistakes "innocent," she means something specific - she believes these errors happen simply because humans aren't perfect at making judgments, and no one is really at fault. However, others disagree with this view. They argue that the philosopher in our example should bear some responsibility for their mistake. Even Fricker herself admits that we could find some reason to blame the philosopher in this situation.

The blameworthiness is more obvious in the following example: Imagine you're at a party and accidentally step on someone's foot because you didn't see them in the crowd. That's different from deliberately stepping on their foot because you're angry with them. Fricker sees the philosopher's mistake as more like the accidental step - a human error that anyone could make. But others argue it's not that simple. Perhaps the philosopher is not lucky to be in a good enough epistemic position, but he still did some injustice.

## Obscure "Prejudice"

Let's look at Fricker's definition further to see how she draws the line. Fricker presents two ways to draw the line. First, she claims that for a case to be testimonial injustice, the witness must be insulted or undermined as a knower. But why the medical ethicist is not insulted as a knower by the philosopher? Second, Fricker defines epistemic injustice as the credibility deficit caused by prejudice. And Fricker defines it as "some ethical poison." ── But what is "ethical poison"? And certainly there is an implicit circularity problem here. Fricker explains that testimonial injustice is unjust because there is some ethical poison involved in it. But if you do not know what is just in the first place, how are you able to tell something is an "ethical poison"?

I believe Fricker is using the figurative metaphor because she believes prejudice is easy to identify. But this view seems oversimplified. In her examples, she typically discusses prejudices that can be overcome through careful reflection or by getting to know the affected individuals better. However, the reality of prejudice is more complex and operates on multiple levels.

Consider two different types of prejudice: what we might call "simple prejudice" and "structurally reinforced prejudice." Simple prejudice consists of unfounded assumptions that can be easily disproven. However, structurally reinforced prejudice creates a more complicated situation where social conditions can actually reinforce stereotypes. For example, consider the stereotype that women are physically weaker than men. When society discourages women from participating in strength training and athletics, women may indeed develop less muscle mass than men - not because of any inherent difference, but because of how social expectations shape behavior and opportunities.

Some prejudices are even more challenging to address because they are supported by seemingly logical arguments. For instance, some people justify traditional gender roles by referring to evolutionary biology, arguing that historical divisions of labor (where men hunted and women cared for children) should inform modern social arrangements. These arguments, while flawed, can appear convincing on the surface and require more sophisticated counter-arguments than simple prejudices.

When we encounter these more deeply rooted prejudices that are reinforced by social structures or seemingly rational arguments, it becomes more difficult to apply Fricker's concept of "ethical poison." These situations may require a further analysis of what prejudice is.
