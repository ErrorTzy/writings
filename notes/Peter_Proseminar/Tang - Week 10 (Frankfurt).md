# Intro

In *Freedom of Will and Concept of a Person*, Frankfurt distinguishes a wanton from a person. According to Frankfurt, the difference lies in that a wanton do not have second-order volition. In this paper, I will analyze this concept and show that "the desire of desire" is redundant. 

# What is Second-order Volition?

Let's say we have someone called John. John has a second-order volition, as defined by Frankfurt, when John "wants a certain desire to be his will." However, this definition requires further clarification.

## Will

First, let's examine the concept of "will." Frankfurt defines it as a specific type of first-order desire that motivates actual action. Yet this definition is confusing. By calling something a first-order desire, it must have some forces that moves us to action. There's no desire that does not provide force to one's action.

For example, if you want to drink water but don't act on this desire because the water is too far away, it's not that the desire itself lacks motivational force. Rather, other competing desires (like laziness) are preventing action. If these obstacles were removed - if the water bottle were within reach and no contrary desires existed - the original desire would naturally lead to action. 

Then what distinguishes a "will" from other desires, since all desires can potentially motivate action? One might simply define will as the desire that explains an action after it occurs. But Frankfurt wants to extend the concept of will to to include future actions. According to his view, if John holds a desire that will lead to future action, assuming his mind remains unchanged, this desire can be classified as will, even if no action has taken place yet. By doing so, it seems that we need to add a disjunct to the definition: a will is a desire (or a set of desires) that explains an action, or *would have explained an action but the action did not take place because there is a change of mind*.

But we are back to the old problem. Any desire "would have explained an action". For example, in the example that you want to drink water, the desire to drink would have explained your action of drinking, except you did not drink due to laziness. It seems that we have to define what a change of mind is in order to restrict the counterfactual situation, since there is always a possible world which a desire that would explain an action. 

But this seems really hard. First, we cannot define the change of mind in terms of the action not having been carried out, or it would be circular. We also cannot claim that any mental change would lead to a change in action, since our minds are constantly changing while some consistency in actions can persists.Therefore some degree of change in desire is allowed for not changing mind. 

But we do not really need to get into this rabbit hole, as long as we introduce an implicit principle: there exists a function that maps one's complete set of desires at any given moment to some action. That is to say, John's state of desires at a given moment would be sufficient to determine a plan to do some action (although John may not know this plan, or belief otherwise). The action in the plan in turns pick out the desire (or a set of desires) that explains the action. In this way, we would not need to add the disjunct, but to modify the definition as: a will is a desire (or a set of desires) that explains a plan of action determined by the total state of desire at a given moment.

There is a further ambiguity in this definition. what does "explain" here mean? The desire that is identified as a will does not sufficiently cause the plan of action, because it is the total state of desires that determines the plan. As long as there is a competing desire emerges in the total state of desires later, the plan may change even if the desire we identified as a will earlier remains the same. But for it to explain the action, loosely speaking, it makes that action happen. I will not explore how exactly are we going to define "make something happen" because I do not know either. But I think it is intuitively plausible to say a will is a desire that makes some action (or an action in a plan) happen.

## Redundancy of Second-order Volition

Now, let's return to Frankfurt's concept of second-order volition. Frankfurt makes an important distinction between second-order volition and simple second-order desire. A second-order desire is straightforward: it's when you want to want something. Second-order volition, however, is more specific: it's when you want to will something. Since will is a particular type of desire, we can think of second-order volition as a subset of second-order desire. This raise the question: What additional element needs to be present, beyond simply wanting to want to drink water, for John to have a second-order volition?

If my analysis of will is correct, then to want a will then is nothing other than to want to want x, and want to be determined to do x. The latter simply is a first-order desire, and it is different from simply want to do x.

Now let's see why Frankfurt believes we need to have a second-order desire. He criticized a wanton for only pursuing whatever course of action he is most inclined to pursue, and a wanton does not care which of his inclination is the strongest. 

But why should I need to mysteriously want to want something in order not to be a wanton? The desire to be determined to do something can, by itself, prevent us from being wantons. The key is understanding that there are different types of desires:

1. Instinctive desires that we simply find ourselves experiencing
2. Regulative desires that emerge through reasoning and deliberation

When someone develops a desire "to be determined to do x," it typically happens through a process of reasoning about why X is justified. The reasoning process obviously shows that they care about which desires they act on. He's not just blindly following his strongest natural impulses.

Someone might ask: Why do we start reasoning about things in the first place, and why does this process cause any regulative desires? The answer is in some sense straightforward. It's simply part of who we are as human beings. We're naturally curious creatures who think about our choices and want to be confident in our decisions. This is such a fundamental aspect of human nature that there may not be a deeper explanation â€“ it's just how we're wired.

In conclusion, Frankfurt's overall idea is to say that persons are able to coordinate desires and chose what to do. But this does not have to appeal to second-order desire. We can admit that there is some faculty that regulates first-order desire, but Frankfurt makes a mistake to say that this faculty would produce a completely redundant, unnatural and mysterious "desire of desire".
