# Can 'I' be defined by ordinary reflexive?

In "The First Person", Anscombe proposed that 'I' cannot have an explanation. In this paper, I first recap Anscombe's argument. Then I show what kind of explanation Anscombe wants and why Anscombe failed to provide such an explanation. I propose a possible explanation that Anscombe wants, and close this paper by answering to a possible objection.

## Anscombe's Argument

Anscombe first argues that 'I' may be defined by reflexives. Then she distinguishes "ordinary reflexive" and "indirect reflexive". Indirectly reflexive, according to Anscombe, must be defined by 'I' and thus cannot be used to define 'I'. On the other hand, ordinary reflexive is defined as:

- a word that specifies for hearers an object designated by the speaker of the sentence.

Then, she proposes a possible definition for 'I': the word each person P uses in speaking of oneself (knowingly and intentionally). Anscombe objects that this will not work, because there exists some word W that: 

1. Each person P intends to use W to speak of an object O, and 
2. unbeknownst to the person P, the object O is the speaker P.

Also, Anscombe proposes that, the standard for something to be 'I' includes that,

3. It specifies an object, and
4. the speaker knows the identity between the object and the speaker.

'I' is not W because (4) is incompatible with (2), i.e. P necessarily knows that O is identical to P. Therefore, if the definition does not rule out W, then the definition fails by being too broad; So we need to see when P uses W,  whether it counts as "P speaking of oneself." If it counts, then the definition does not rule out W. 

Given using indirect reflexive will incur circularity, we need to understand "oneself" as the ordinary reflexive. Then 'oneself' here is, by the definition of ordinary reflexive, something that can specify object P *for hearers*. But W indeed can specify object P *for hearers*, though the speakers do not intend to do so. Therefore, W fits the definition, making the definition fail. Since the reflexive pronouns failed to explain 'I', Anscombe concludes that, there can be no explanation for 'I.'

## Response

However, Anscombe's failure to construct an explanation does not follow that there is no such explanation. Let us push back the discussion a bit and ask what kind of explanation Anscombe wants. Is it a definition that people need when they don't know a word? No, because this kind of definition only tells us how to understand a word when we see it, but doesn't necessarily tell us how to use it. Anscombe accepts how we understand the word 'I' from a third-person perspective. She acknowledges that it's nonsensical for Descartes to say "I am not Descartes" from a third-person viewpoint. Her concern lies with the explanation of the *use* of 'I' from a first-person perspective. What we're seeking is akin to a manual for the correct use of words to express existing ideas.

To further illustrate what would "usage manual of words" implies, consider the following scenario: When Earth had just formed as a planet, its temperature was still extremely high. Only a very thin layer on the surface had cooled down and solidified, while beneath it remained in a molten state. Due to the movement of the magma, the cooled surface would be torn apart, forming cracks. Now, imagine if these cracks happened to form the shape of the phrase "I am Donald Trump." Could this be considered evidence that "language already existed when Earth was first formed"?

For anyone with common sense, this cannot count as such evidence. This is because the cracks on the surface *imitate* language, but *are not* language. For shape or sound to be language, it must be produced by a conscious speaker *using words* to present the relevant mind state. Similarly, when a parakeet says "I am Donald Trump", we do not think it speaks English. We think it imitates the sound of English. But this does not stop people from looking up the dictionary and forming an understanding that someone MAGA guy is here. But this is merely a false inference because only language expresses meaning, and what was shown by the cracks or said by the parakeet does not belong to language at all. To repeat, for any actual symbol to be a word in language, it is necessary that there is a speaker, and the speaker has some mind state, and the speaker uses the word to represent the mind state according to some language manual.

Now we can see that Anscombe's definition of "oneself" as something that specifies an object designated by the speaker for the hearers is destined to fail. This is because it serves as a definition for understanding, not as a manual for use. For an explanation to work as a manual of use, it must include a description of what is on the speaker's mind. 

Therefore, I propose the following explanation:

- 'I' is a word that a person (P) uses to express an object that P believes the hearers will take to be the speaker of the word.

Is this proposal successful? Let's consider Anscombe's three conditions for a successful explanation of 'I', i.e. (3), (4) and

5. 'I' is guaranteed to refer.

My proposal obviously satisfies (3). And I argue that condition (4) is wrong because there seems to be no problem with Anscombe's (or other non-referential theorists') use of 'I', as long as they believe the hearers will understand what they mean. My proposal satisfies (5) not because it refers to the Cartesian Ego, but because the existence of a speaker is necessary for using language at all. And the speaker cannot be ignorant of the fact that they are the one speaking.
