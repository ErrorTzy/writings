# Can 'I' be defined by ordinary reflexive?

In "The First Person", Anscombe proposed that 'I' is not a referring expression. In this paper, I show that 'I' can be defined by ordinary reflexive pronouns.

## Anscombe's Argument

Anscombe first distinguished "ordinary reflexive" and "indirect reflexive". Ordinary reflexive is defined as a word that specifies *for hearers* an object designated by the speaker of the sentence. Indirectly reflexive, according to Anscombe, must be defined by 'I' and thus cannot be used to define 'I'. Then, she proposed a possible definition for 'I': the word each person P uses in speaking of oneself (knowingly and intentionally). Anscombe objects that this will not work, because there exists some word W that: 

1. Each person P intends to use W to speak of an object O, and 
2. unbeknownst to the person P, the object O is the speaker P.

'I' is not W because P necessarily knows that O is identical to P. If the definition does not rule out W, then the definition fails; So when P uses W, does it count as "P speaking of oneself"? If we understand "oneself" as the ordinary reflexive, then 'oneself' here is something that can specify object P *for hearers*. But W indeed can specify object P *for hearers*, though the speakers do not intend to do so. Therefore, W fits the definition, making the definition fail.

## Problem with Anscombe's Ordinary Reflexive

However, I believe the definition of ordinary reflexive that Anscombe provided is incomplete. Consider the following scenario: When Earth had just formed as a planet, its temperature was still extremely high. Only a very thin layer on the surface had cooled down and solidified, while beneath it remained in a molten state. Due to the movement of the magma, the cooled surface would be torn apart, forming cracks. Now, imagine if these cracks happened to form the shape of the phrase "I am Donald Trump." Could this be considered evidence that "language already existed when Earth was first formed"?

For anyone with common sense, this cannot count as such evidence. This is because the cracks on the surface *imitate* language, but *are not* language. For shape or sound to be language, it must be produced by a conscious speaker with the relevant mind state. Similarly, when a parakeet says "I am Donald Trump", we do not think it speaks English. We think it imitates the sound of English. But this does not stop hearers from forming the understanding that someone MAGA guy is here. But this is merely a false inference because only language expresses meaning, and what was shown by the cracks or said by the parakeet does not belong to language at all.

Now if we go back to Anscombe's definition of "oneself", i.e. it specifies *for hearers* an object designated by the speaker of the sentence, it is an incomplete definition. Anscombe wants to restrict us to a third-person perspective, but for hearers to correctly identify a word symbol to as a word, it must presuppose that some referring action is happening in the speaker's mind. Then we can add 'and for any P, when P uses it, P *designates* P' to the definition. This move will make the definition be immune to Anscombe's objection because if P designates P, P cannot not know that they are talking about P.

## Possible Objection

One may object that, there are three standards for what Anscombe took to be 'I':

1. It specifies an object, and
2. The speaker knows the identity between the object and the speaker, and
3. It guarantees it never fails to refer.

After I changed the definition of ordinary reflexive pronoun, 1 and 2 are satisfied while 3 is not. Therefore my modification is not successful. 

But 'I' does not refer to the Cartesian ego, and I agree with Anscombe that 3 could be only satisfied by the Cartesian ego. Sometimes it may fail to refer. For example, it is possible that I am actually ten thinking organs working together at the same time, but 'I' only refers to a thing that is numerically one. Therefore, I hold that 3 is not really a condition for 'I' to refer at all.
