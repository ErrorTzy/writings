Two problems of scientific explanation:

1. when is something explained?
2. why explanation is good?

The answer to the second problem misleads the answer to the first 

## I. False Ideals

Three false ideals:

1. explanation is a relation simply between theory and facts, like truth
2. explanatory power cannot be logically separated from truth or acceptability
3. explanation is the ultimate end for science

Van Fraassen's alternative: 

Answer to the first ideal: 

- explanation is not only the relation between theory and facts, but also related to our acceptance of a theory, i.e. our epistemic status
- There may be a distinction between "theory can explain facts" and "We can explain facts *by* theory", though the former may be an ellipsis for the latter

Answer to the second ideal:

- Explanation is not logically tied to acceptability because we may explain with an unacceptable theory 
- Explanation is not logically tied to truth because a false theory can explain.

Answer to the third ideal:

- If a theory does not explain and explanation is the ultimate aim, then we should not accept it. But in practice, we accept theories that fails to explain something. We accept theories because it works.
- If two theories are equally good in other aspects, then we should no accept it. But in practice, we accept theories that explain less, e.g. quantum mechanics, problems with hidden variables.

## II. Biased History


### 1. Hempel

Two main criteria for explanation:

1. explanatory relevance: explanatory information (initial condition + hypothesis) gives good grounds (fits DN/IS) for believing that the prediction is true 
	- Problem: not sufficient due to barometer example (asymmetry of explanation), not necessary due to paresis example (explanation with low probability hypothesis)
2. testibility

### 2. Beckner, Putnam, and Salmon

Fixing the problem of explanatory relevance: now you don't need to give a derivation. You just need to show that there exist a possible initial condition such that it can predict the actual facts now. (i.e. the actual facts are consistent with the theory) But consistency is too weak a condition for explanation, since irrelevant things can also be consistent but explains nothing.

Salmon: to explain is to exhibit statistically relevant factors.

Van Fraassen's criticism: 
- Using the example of radioactive decay, Salmon's criterion would allow us to "explain" things that fundamental physics considers fundamentally random and unexplainable (like why a specific atom decays at a specific time).
- statistic relevance explanation sounds too shallow for an explanation

### 3. Global Properties

Science does not explain individual facts but general regularities.

Friedman: $S_1$ explains $S_2$ iff 

1. $S_{1}+K$ implies $S_2$ (K is our background knowledge); and 
2. $S_1$ unifies and simplifies the set of its consequence relative to $K$.
	- Problem: this does not work, according to note 15

Greeno: $P(\frac{M_{1}}{S_{1}})$ measures how well a factor explains another.

- Problem: Run into asymmetry problem again

### 4. The Major Difficulties

1. There are some cases that are in the theory's domain but the request for explanation is rejected.
2. Asymmetry of explanation

### 5. Causality

Salmon: Events are bound into causal chains by two relations:

1. Spatio temperal continuity
2. statistical relevance

This is from the principle of common cause, which demands hidden variables.

Brody: adding essense to explanation

Problem: modern science is not formulated in terms of essence and causes.

### 6. Why Questions

"Why P" is a request for explanation, but "Why *John* ate the apple" and "Why John ate the *apple*" are different. Therefore, there's something beyond the propositional content. We may disambiguate the sentence by adding "Why John in contrast to X ate the apple."

Q is a correct answer to why P in contrast to X only if Q gives reasons to expect that P

Problem: Cannot handle barometer asymmetry

## III. The Solution

### 1. Prejudice

1. Necessary and sufficient account for E explains T is context insensitive
2. Explanatory power is context insensitive

### 2. Diagnosis
