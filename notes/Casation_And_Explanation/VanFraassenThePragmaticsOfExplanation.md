Two problems of scientific explanation:

1. when is something explained?
2. why explanation is good?

The answer to the second problem misleads the answer to the first 

## I. False Ideals

Three false ideals:

1. explanation is a relation simply between theory and facts, like truth
2. explanatory power cannot be logically separated from truth or acceptability
3. explanation is the ultimate end for science

Van Fraassen's alternative: 

Answer to the first ideal: 

- explanation is not only the relation between theory and facts, but also related to our acceptance of a theory, i.e. our epistemic status
- There may be a distinction between "theory can explain facts" and "We can explain facts *by* theory", though the former may be an ellipsis for the latter

Answer to the second ideal:

- Explanation is not logically tied to acceptability because we may explain with an unacceptable theory 
- Explanation is not logically tied to truth because a false theory can explain.

Answer to the third idea:

-
