To start with, I wish to bring about an old paradox. There are two possible approaches to defining what constitutes an explanation. First, we can examine instances of explanatory practice and derive an account of explanation from them. Second, we can directly formulate an account of explanation by philosophical reflection. However, a paradox raises here.

The first method suggests that we cannot know the criterion of explanation in the first place (or we should adopt the second method). But the problem is, how do we know the instances of explanatory practices are the correct instances? It is possible that most of the instances that we investigate are not really explanation. In this case, then, the account draw from the instances would likely to be unreliable.

The second method suggests that we are unable to identify what counts as an instance of explanation (or we should adopt the first method). However, if we develop a tentative account of explanation, how can we verify its correctness? Since this approach assumes that we cannot reliably identify explanatory instances, no instance that fall into the account of explanation would verify it.

I do not intend to resolve this paradox here, as I have not studied any relevant literature. However, I want to offer a rationale for adopting the first approach. When we define the term 'explanation,' we can confidently identify it as an instance of explanation. It makes no sense to ask, 'Yes, but is that really an explanation?' just as it makes no sense to ask, 'Yes, but is that baby really Scott?' after naming a baby 'Scott.' Even if the use of the word 'explanation' changes over time, there will be clear instances of explanations that the community agrees upon. For these clear cases, we have strong justification to regard them as correct instances, grounded in our linguistic usage.

Given our methodology preference, we should start theorizing from our explanatory practices, i.e. asking and answering to "why" questions. What we ultimately want to draw from these instances is the common relation between *asking why* and *the right answers to them*. In a slightly formalized way to put it, if $A$ explains "Why $B$?", we want to find out the right depiction of the relation $R$ such that $R_{AB}$, i.e. $A$ explains $B$.

Now we want to look into the set of criterion that would 


However, in our linguistic practice of explanation, at least some members in the set of criterion that makes the answer would partially depend on the context. 

questions like "Why did Adam eat the apple?" are ambiguous. They can be understood in several ways, e.g.

- Why did ***Adam*** (instead of God) eat the apple?  
- Why did Adam ***eat*** (instead of juggle) the apple?  
- Why did Adam eat the ***apple*** (instead of the snake)?

Different readings to the question would determine what kind of response count as appropriate to the question.







B. Peter Railton distinguishes between being an ideal explanatory text and being explanatory information: explanatory information is information about the contents of the ideal text.  However, this view gives rise to an objection: some information about the ideal text does not seem explanatory.  Explain this objection.  How serious a problem is this for Railton’s view, in your opinion?
