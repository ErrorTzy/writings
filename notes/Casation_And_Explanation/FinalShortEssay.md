## The dilemma about the objectivity of grounding

The very concept of the grounding relation faces a dilemma. On the first horn, grounding is tightly connected to explanation. If we understand grounding as an explanatory relation, and explanation is in some sense subjective or mind‑dependent, then it seems that grounding inherits that subjectivity and mind-dependence. On the second horn, grounding is supposed to be a worldly relation. And a worldly relation should be objective and mind‑independent, because we use it to articulate the ontological structure of reality. In this paper, I wish to explicate two different views of grounding: the one that comes with good reasons to be objective and mind-independent seems to start from the middle, and the more familiar one seems to connect with explanation is seems vulnerable to subjectivity. Along the lines, this paper answers the first three questions in the doc.

### Diagnosis of the problem

Where does this dilemma arise? Its source, I think, is the Aristotelian metaphysics introduced in Schaffer’s paper “On What Grounds What.” Schaffer distinguishes two metaphysical projects: the Quinean project of saying what exists and the Aristotelian project of saying what grounds what. In his view, the Quinean task is almost trivial once we adopt ontological permissivism: numbers, properties, mereological parts, and fictional characters all exist in a thin, Quinean sense.

Taking permissivism seriously forces us to have a thin sense of "existence", as opposed to the traditional, thicker notion of "existence". When realists, conceptualists, and nominalists debate abstract objects, they are really asking whether such objects are in‑the‑world and mind‑independent. Roughly: realists say they are objective but mind‑independent; conceptualists say they are objective but mind‑dependent; nominalists treat them as subjective and mind‑dependent.

There are good reasons to embrace permissivism and sidestep that debate. Whatever we think about the existence of abstract objects, some works need to be done. For example,  even if the One‑Over‑Many argument does not force us to posit universals, we still need an account of how two distinct objects can share what look like the same properties whatsoever. The project of grounding, arguably, can give such an account by figuring our what grounds the objects that instantiates similar properties. What matters is whether particulars are more fundamental than the universals, or the other way around. Therefore, we can give such an account of resemblance of distinct objects in terms of grounding.

So far, so good. But all of this concerns the relata. What about the grounding relation itself? A relation is an n‑place predicate, and predicates are abstract objects. As soon as we ask whether the grounding relation is objective and mind‑independent, we are back in the familiar realist‑vs‑nominalist dispute over abstract objects. Surely, this does not undermine the permissivist project: even if “existence” is stripped of mind‑independence, it remains meaningful to ask, as a further question, whether a given existent is objective and mind‑independent. But it seems impossible to give an account in the Aristotelian framework, because in this framework, to give an account of something is to analyze its grounds. But it almost sound circular to give an analysis of grounding relation in terms of grounding. (Maybe literature on meta-ground talk about this? I don't know. I haven't read them yet.) Maybe we need to turn to some good old insights about these good old problems.

### Preliminary Analysis about objectivity and mind-dependence

Before we begin, it is useful to sketch a rough analysis of the concepts of “objectivity” and “mind‑dependence”:

Mind‑dependence is fairly clear: if no minds existed, there would be no pain, whereas chairs could still exist. Therefore, "I'm in pain" is a mind-dependent fact, while "there is a chair" isn't. One might analyze this dependence in terms of grounding, but here we can for the sake of argument treat it as primitive; this avoids circularity if we want to analyze grounding in terms of mind‑independence. Another clarification is needed here. Although chairs themselves are mind‑independent, the concept of a chair is not. A mereological nihilist, for example, holds that there are only chair‑arranged atoms and thus no chairs. But is because their ontological language does not quantify over chairs. Once we speak ordinary English, however, chairs do exist mind‑independently. So the concept relies on language, and language depends on minds, yet it does not follow that the objects picked out by the English term “chair” are mind‑dependent. Even in a world without concepts or language, the very objects we call chairs would still be there.

The distinction between subjectivity and objectivity is much more obscure. I want to define subjectivity in terms of ambiguity or vagueness of our language. We would say that, whether Dwayne Johnson is bald is a straightforward, objective matter, but whether Eli Hirsch is bald seems to depend on how we draw the borderline for baldness. But there is no rational basis for drawing one line instead of another. We might therefore say that a fact is subjective when its truth cannot be settled solely by theoretical means. But one may think that, even if we speak a perfectly precise language, we may still encounter the distinction between objectivity and subjectivity. For example, we may speak a perfect language that has no ambiguity or vagueness, and adopts moral subjectivism. Then it would follow that "Murder is bad" may be objectively true for me, but also objectively false for you. But there is some sense in which "Murder is bad" is a subjective fact, though all the relative truth value can be determined objectively. But relative truth of a single proposition is not something I want. And we can also say "Murder is bad" in a moral subjectivism language really means is "I don't like murder", and different people expresses different proposition by saying "murder is bad". Therefore, the moral subjectivists are not speaking a perfectly precise language when they are saying "murder is bad", and if they do, everything would be objective. No fact expressed by proposition would be subjective if we get rid of ambiguity and vagueness.

The boundary between subjectivity and objectivity is much more obscure. I want to analyze subjectivity into linguistic indeterminacy: a claim is subjective when its truth depends on ambiguities or vagueness in the terms we use. For example, whether Dwayne Johnson is bald is plausibly an objective matter, whereas whether Eli Hirsch counts as bald hinges on how we fix the threshold for baldness, a threshold for which no single, rationally mandatory line can be drawn. In this sense, a statement is subjective when theory alone cannot settle its truth‑value.

One might object that subjectivity could persist even in a perfectly precise language. Suppose an ideal language contains no ambiguity or vagueness at all, and its speakers adopt moral subjectivism. In that setting, “Murder is bad” could be true for me and false for you. Therefore, in this case "Murder is bad" is still a subjective fact. But if this is a precise language for moral subjectivism, the sentence "Murder is bad" would really function as an indexical shorthand for something like “I disapprove of murder.” Different speakers would therefore be expressing different propositions. Therefore, since they are expressing different propositions, there is no single fact for "Murder is bad", not to say a subjective fact. Maybe this sounds like a joke but I mean it: moral subjectivism is an objective account of morality. Hence, if we purge every trace of vagueness and hidden indexicality, every proposition we utter is objectively true or false; what we call “subjective facts” owe their appearance to unresolved linguistic indeterminacy. It would follow that whether something is objective or not depends on how precise you want your language to be.

Admittedly, this does not fully capture what we mean by "subjectivity". In some sense, we say our perception is subjective. That definitely doesn't mean that our perception has some linguistic indeterminacy. It is closer to saying that our perception is perspectival, and every one sees in slightly different ways. For now I will ignore this sense of subjectivity because the sense of subjectivity and mind-independence I have analyzed so far will suffice for the motivation of "out-there-in-the-worldness".

This analysis is still very preliminary. But hopefully it helps clarify the motivation for calling anything "objective and mind-independent." 

## What's out there?

What make people think anything is objective and mind-independent at all? 

Let us start from the uncontroversial case: ordinary objects. Why do we treat the claim “There are tables and chairs” as both objective and mind‑independent? The answer is straightforward. We are perceptually disposed to encounter tables and chairs as items in the world—that is, outside the head. Although the concepts table and chair have vague borderlines, this does not infect the everyday English sentence “There are tables and chairs” with indeterminacy. Because we can point to paradigm instances, the sentence retains a determinate truth‑value; therefore, on the assumptions of ordinary English, the fact that there are tables and chairs counts as objective.

A similar appeal to perception motivates the classical One‑over‑Many argument. We seem directly to perceive resemblance among particulars, and the naïve picture of perception says that it reveals what is really “out there.” That thought encourages the idea that something worldly must account for the resemblance we notice. Armstrong argues that only universals can provide an adequate explanation; consequently, universals themselves must be entities in the world. Given Armstrong’s definition of universals as real existents, speakers who adopt his framework will regard the statement “Universals exist” as an objective fact.

By the same token, if grounding is to count as mind‑independent and objective, and given that we think what is out there by perception, grounding should be motivated by perception. One strategy is to say that we perceive grounding directly. Maybe we could perceive some relation directly, like spacial relation "The chair is under the table". But can we say we perceive grounding directly?

At least a necessary condition for thinking that we can perceiving grounding directly is to be able to perceive its relata directly. Notice that this does not require us to perceive all cases of grounding directly. We can say "A is under B" is a worldly relation because we can see "The chair is under the table", but we obviously cannot see "the proton is under the neutron". Therefore, assuming that we can perceive grounding directly, we must find examples of concrete ordinary objects.

Bennett uses building relation to explicate the intuition behind grounding, but I believe this is not the full story. (I don't had time to read Bennett in the final week, though. I'm not sure if she has more sophisticated account) Maybe we can perceive building relation, but "building" is diachronic. Grounding, on the other hand, is synchronic or atemporal. To make sense of this feature of grounding, I suggest that at least part of the motivation behind taking grounding as "out there in the world" is the perceptual phenomenon of "seeing‑as". We can perceive Socrates as a single person or, alternatively, as the mereological sum of his body‑parts. This looks very like how grounding relation's relata: they are almost identical, but not really: Socrates is not a sum, nor a set. What makes "seeing‑as" synchronic relies on the fact that, when I realize I can Socrates as a sum of all the parts, in some sense I'm perceiving two objects at the same time: Socrates and the sum of all his body parts. 

One might object that seeing‑as by itself does not establish any order of priority or asymmetry. I disagree to some extent. Although we can, in principle, view Socrates as a composite, we ordinarily do not. Suppose Socrates is standing before you and ask, “How many objects are in front of you?” If you answer anything other than "one", something has gone awry. Perceptual practice therefore privileges one way of seeing over the others: under normal conditions we perceive Socrates rather than the aggregate of his parts.

The difficulty, however, is that this observation secures only a single priority relation; it does not yield a fully articulated metaphysical hierarchy. Yet complete coverage is not essential. We do not need to witness every application of addition in order to understand the concept of addition. Likewise, once we possess the concept of an asymmetric relation, we can construct a formal system ordered by it.

A further worry arises. On my account of _seeing‑as_, Socrates is prior to his body‑parts, whereas the standard view holds that the mereological parts ground the whole. Nevertheless, one could defend a grounding structure whose most fundamental layer begins with ordinary objects, and that picture could be motivated by _seeing‑as_ alone.  Given the transparency of perception, we have reason to treat what we perceive as mind‑independent; and, now that grounding is disambiguated in terms of _seeing‑as_, it is also objective. Hence the proposed grounding structure here is both mind‑independent and objective.

### Turning to explanation

Admittedly, the *usual* way philosophers talk about grounding is different. Bennett’s diachronic notion of *building* is often part of the motivation. Partly this is because seeing‑as is probably a primitive notion that may be hard to expand into a formal system. Then we took some different notion, like "building" to expand seeing‑as. Yet how could we *perceive* an atemporal building relation that warrants saying grounding is *out there in the world*?

Perhaps some creature could directly perceive what we might call ‘Bennetting‑as’; I cannot. Here, I suspect, is where *explanation* sneaks in and screws everything up.

First, ‘seeing‑as‑grounding’ arguably *already* explains enough.  Ask an ordinary person, ‘Why does that man you are looking at exist?’ and you will likely get an incredulous stare: you have reached the explanatory bottom.  Ask, ‘Why do his body‑parts exist?’ and the natural answer is, ‘Because he exists.’  Those answers may not satisfy metaphysicians, but they are acceptable in everyday explanation.

Metaphysicians, however, want more.  Aristotle famously writes:

> The natural way of doing this is to start from the things which are more knowable and obvious to us and proceed towards those which are clearer and more knowable by nature; for the same things are not 'knowable relatively to us' and 'knowable' without qualification. So in the present inquiry we must follow this method and advance from what is more obscure by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable by nature. (Physics I, 184a17-23)

What Aristotle may mean is that, what we perceive is clearer to us, but something logically simpler (fewer properties, repeatable) may be clearer by nature.  Hence a metaphysician (or a physicist) might say Socrates exists because his atoms exist. However I stand with Van Fraassen that there is no reason, beyond pragmatic or explanatory virtue, to believe in atoms; at best they offer the best explanation and are empirically adequate.

Once we accept this Aristotelian demand for deeper explanation, we probably arrive at contemporary grounding talk. A lot of things haven't been thought through yet, but I think I have written enough to answer the first three questions, and the deadline looms, so I shall end abruptly here.

(A few words on the last problem: It is very hard to understand how could the disjunction PvQ refers to any single fact in the world. I do believe there's something wrong with the semantics of disjunction of fact.)
