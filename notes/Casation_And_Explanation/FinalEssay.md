What could "mind-independent" or "objective" mean?

This confusion comes from the initial aristotlian ontology stated in Schaffer's seminal paper on what grounds what. According to Schaffer, he adopted a permissivism about ontology. In that sense, everything we can talk about exist. Numbers, fictional characters, universals simply exist without further warrant. The task of metaphysics is to discover which existence grounds which. This is a thin sense of existence, in the sense that, whatever work there is, there must be something that does this work. By positing such a position, Schaffer avoids the tedious debate between realists, conceptualists and nominalists. But this comes at a "price". 

The "thick" sense of existence adopted by the realists, conceptualists and nominalists conveys the idea that, if something exists, then it must be "in the world" and objective. If we go back to this traditional way of doing ontology, then whether grounding is objective and mind-dependent becomes fuzzy. If one adopt realism, then it's objective and mind-independent; if one adopt conceptualism, then it is objective and mind-dependent; if one adopt nominalism, one may say it's subjective and mind-dependent. Schaffer wants to adopt the "thin existence" to evade the controversy in the relata of grounding, and arguably solve the problem of objectivity and mind-dependency by there hierarchy: if something is grounded in mind, then it is mind-dependent. Objectivity is something more problematic, but assuming that we definite objectivity in tem




|            | Mind-dependent          | Mind-independent       |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Objective  | I'm in pain             | There is a chair       |
| Subjective | ? The movie is an art ? | ? The movie is boring? |

What's bad about mind-dependent and objective? 

Mind independence: it follows that it is publicly accessible in principle.
Objective: No a matter of personal taste, if P is objective, the it can't be the case that someone utters P and another utters not-P, and they both hold true. The movie is boring is subjective but the movie is 2hrs long is objective.

objectivity is not a matter of taste. subjectivity is a matter of taste. What could that mean?

They do not even co-refer. I am in pain is an objective fact, but it is mind-dependent because if I have no mind there can't really be pain.

Vagueness? To say Dwayne Johnson is bald is an objective matter, but to sat Eli Hirsch is bald is a subjective matter. Then we may say, the truth of a sentence is objective iff on every precisification the sentence is true. 

But once we speak a precise language, then everything is objective. (Though from )

A determines B depends on A metaphysically explains B
A metaphysically explains B depends on A determines B

Motivation: Whether a things is objective is relative to how vague one's conceptual scheme is. If one adopt vagueness, pluralism or relativism, e.g. what is good, what is beautiful, then it would be a subjective matter to say if something is beautiful. If one adopt a precise language, then everything would be objective.

Problem: 1. A precise language makes everything objective? 2. "I'm in pain" is mind-dependent, but seems objective.

Really a problem for Aristotlian permissivism? "Some work needs to be done one way or another", no matter it is "in the world" or "in the head"; they don't care about mind-dependence

"Intuition as intention" account; Armstrong, reason for existential commitment -- you don't need to believe; Schaffer, whatever work to be done, there is some worker -- you can believe no matter what it turns out.

Armstrong: whatever we perceive is in the world, we perceive resemblance; therefore resemblance is in the world

doctrine of perception as reason for in the world; perception backs ontological commitment. Aristotlian permissivm has a thin existence, therefore to say something exist no longer detect in-the-worldness; but it can still adopt the perception doctrine to detect "in-the-worldness"

Now the problem is, which part of our perception perceives grounding?

What's weird about (full-)grounding is that, in most of the cases its relata are in a rough sense looks almost identical: Socrates and singleton Socrates; P and Q and P, Q (an exception is disjunction, which I shall come back later). We can see something as one, or as the compositions of its parts. But of course we cannot see Socrates as Plato, and therefore there cannot be a grounding relation between Socrates and Plato

Seeing-as, however, has no order. If we want grounding to be something that is indispensable for seeing-as, we need some sort of priority in perception. But we do have one. Even if we see Socrates as a composition of its parts, it doesn't mean that we usually do. Assume Socrates is standing in front of you, and I ask how many objects is in front of you. If you say a number other than one, there's probably something going wrong with you. We do have some prioritized perception of seeing-as.

But this is still not enough. The singleton Socrates grounds singleton singleton Socrates. How is this order established?

Is the asymmetry of grounding always intelligible? Consider 

'''
It is usually accepted that, for any (metaphysical) determination relation R, there is a priority relation between the two relata. For example, if we have Rab, a is in some sense prior to b (or b depends upon R). We have looked at two examples: Groundsab (a grounds b) and Truthab (fact a makes b true). You previously looked at causation. Why do some (or most) think that these relations are objective and mind independent? What do you think the upshot of treating these relations as objective is (if any)?

Now, much of the literature has tried to treat these relations as explanatory. That is, when a bears R to b, a explains b. So, determination relations are explanatory in the sense that they are either explanations themselves, or they back explanations. One benefit of this is that it gives us insight into these relations. We can know features about grounding (it’s irreflexive, transitive, non-monotonic, etc) because we know features about explanation. If we severe the link between determination relations and explanations, this seemingly poses an epistemic problem. We seemingly lose our understanding of the determination relation. Why is this the case? Suppose we do severe this link, like Asay wants to for truth-making, how do you think we can know features about these relations?

Suppose that Thompson and Maurin are right and that, rather than severing the link between explanation and determination relations, we should hold that they are not mind-independent relations. What does this look like? Does this necessarily mean that, if ‘a ground b’ is mind-dependent, then without minds, it would not be the case that a grounds b? Do you think this changes the relata of ground (worldly facts)?

One of the purported promises of grounding is that it will provide a layered view of reality. At the bottom you have the fundamental facts and each additional layer, the facts depend on the previous layer. One nice gloss is that the facts ‘fully explain’ the facts at the previous layer. Additionally, it is thought that if we duplicate the fundamental facts, we will duplicate the entirety of the layered reality (since the grounds necessitate the grounded facts). Now, suppose we take a canonical case of grounding P grounds PvQ where P is a funadmental fact and Q is false proposition. Also consider PvR where R is a distinct false proposition (from Q). One explanation for the difference in identity between these facts is that PvQ could have been grounded in Q but PvR could not have been. What explains this fact? Why is it not the grounds?
