What could "mind-independent" or "objective" mean?

|            | Mind-dependent          | Mind-independent       |

| Objective  | I'm in pain             | There is a chair       |

What's bad about mind-dependent and objective?

objectivity is not a matter of taste. subjectivity is a matter of taste. What could that mean?

They do not even co-refer. I am in pain is an objective fact, but it is mind-dependent because if I have no mind there can't really be pain.

Vagueness? To say Dwayne Johnson is bald is an objective matter, but to sat Eli Hirsch is bald is a subjective matter. Then we may say, the truth of a sentence is objective iff on every precisification the sentence is true. 

But once we speak a precise language, then everything is objective. (Though from )

A determines B depends on A metaphysically explains B
A metaphysically explains B depends on A determines B

Motivation: Whether a things is objective is relative to how vague one's conceptual scheme is. If one adopt vagueness, pluralism or relativism, e.g. what is good, what is beautiful, then it would be a subjective matter to say if something is beautiful. If one adopt a precise language, then everything would be objective.

Problem: 1. A precise language makes everything objective? 2. "I'm in pain" is mind-dependent, but seems objective.


It is usually accepted that, for any (metaphysical) determination relation R, there is a priority relation between the two relata. For example, if we have Rab, a is in some sense prior to b (or b depends upon R). We have looked at two examples: Groundsab (a grounds b) and Truthab (fact a makes b true). You previously looked at causation. Why do some (or most) think that these relations are objective and mind independent? What do you think the upshot of treating these relations as objective is (if any)?

Now, much of the literature has tried to treat these relations as explanatory. That is, when a bears R to b, a explains b. So, determination relations are explanatory in the sense that they are either explanations themselves, or they back explanations. One benefit of this is that it gives us insight into these relations. We can know features about grounding (it’s irreflexive, transitive, non-monotonic, etc) because we know features about explanation. If we severe the link between determination relations and explanations, this seemingly poses an epistemic problem. We seemingly lose our understanding of the determination relation. Why is this the case? Suppose we do severe this link, like Asay wants to for truth-making, how do you think we can know features about these relations?

Suppose that Thompson and Maurin are right and that, rather than severing the link between explanation and determination relations, we should hold that they are not mind-independent relations. What does this look like? Does this necessarily mean that, if ‘a ground b’ is mind-dependent, then without minds, it would not be the case that a grounds b? Do you think this changes the relata of ground (worldly facts)?

One of the purported promises of grounding is that it will provide a layered view of reality. At the bottom you have the fundamental facts and each additional layer, the facts depend on the previous layer. One nice gloss is that the facts ‘fully explain’ the facts at the previous layer. Additionally, it is thought that if we duplicate the fundamental facts, we will duplicate the entirety of the layered reality (since the grounds necessitate the grounded facts). Now, suppose we take a canonical case of grounding P grounds PvQ where P is a funadmental fact and Q is false proposition. Also consider PvR where R is a distinct false proposition (from Q). One explanation for the difference in identity between these facts is that PvQ could have been grounded in Q but PvR could not have been. What explains this fact? Why is it not the grounds?
