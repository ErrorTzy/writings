more obvious way: science tells us entities and properties, therefore, science tells us about the world in itself

less obvious way: distinction between what is the case and what had to be the case. For example, people separate causation and correlation; a scientific law vs. a contingent truth

two tasks: predict (describe before it happens) ...AND explain why (find out laws/causes)

**ampliative argument**: the content of the conclusion goes beyond the content of the premises; Truth-perseving

**erosion proof**: Even if you add a premise (that is coherent with other premises), the conclusion does not change

Personal Probabilities

A wants money --> A goes to bank: we infer that "A believes bank gives A money"

belief/disbelief is a too coarse-grained category; We are more confident in some belief and less in others; So we distribute personal probabilities to beliefs, i.e. degrees of belief/credences

We can measure degrees of belief by behavior


**Argument Strength**: the degree of the confidence a person *should be* if the person is sure of the premises

Example: 
```
P: Katie's life-time free throw average is 73%
---
---[0.73]
C: Katie will have a free throw next time
```


The strength of the conclusion is 73% 

ampliative
- abductive: Cheese is missing --> Mice!
- inductive: rely on the principle that unchecked case will be like the checked cases

Something right about positivism: shitting on Metaphysics&theology
Something wrong about positivism: Metaphysics&theology are nonsense; esp. modal claims should be acceptable

Arch project: Accurately shit on metaphysics and theology but don't shit on electrons and modal propositions

Positivism:
Modal statements (e.g. laws of natural) are reduced to the feature of our language; 
Electrons are reduced to experiences

Positivism failed, but how to save some of their ideas


### Hempel's DN and IS models:

reducing explanation to description; positivism-friendly

Scientific explanation should only consists of laws.

You may explain why the length of the shadow in terms of the height of the flag, but it seems off to explain the reason why the flag has height h because it casts certain shadow.


The thing we want to explain: explanandum
The thing explaining: explainan
explainandum + explainan = explanation

Let conclusion be the explanandum and the premises be the explainan.

**Hempel's first modal: Deductive-nomological (DN model)**

To make your derivation an explanation, the derivation must
- be deductively valid
- include at least one natural law in your premises, and the argument is no longer valid if you remove this natural law.
- All the premises must be true in order to explain.
- All the premises must be empirically verifiable

Asymmetry of explanation: If P explains Q, then Q does not explain P
If we don't restrict ourselves to positivists' toolkit, then we may use causation to explain.
Hempel's answer: this asymmetry is just pragmatic.
Suspicion: pragmatic is enough?

**Problem (Asymmetry)**: Flag-pole 
**Hempel's response**: it sounds bananas, but strictly speaking it still explains. We just don't want to hear about these answer, i.e. the asymmetry is in pragmatics; Prediction and explanation are the same

**Problem (Lawless Explanation)**: Why did the ink spill? Because I bumped the table.
**Hempel's response**: You are implicitly appealing to the law

**Problem (Irrelevant Explanation)**: A man taking birth control pills and being sexually active. You cannot explain him not being pregnant because he is taking birth control pills. In other words, explanation is not erosion proof, but derivation is erosion proof.

Also, you can conjoin theory A and theory B and derive B. Does the conjunction of A and B explains B?
In one word, derivation could contain irrelevant information
**Possible Response**: Laws should not be too broad to cover irrelevant instances.

**Hempel's second model: inductive-statistical**
Motivation: derivation is too deterministic, and no actual science has been successful in predicting just by laws and initial conditions

- be inductively sound
- include at least one (statistical) natural law in your premises, and the argument is no longer sound if you remove this natural law.
- All the premises must be true in order to explain.
- All the premises must be empirically verifiable
- RMS(Requirement of maximal specificity): gist: it is a inductive argument because it is relativized to a background information, or it will be deductive. If there is some unadded information in the background information that would change the confidence value of the conclusion, then you have not yet satisfied RMS.

Problem for RMS: There may be some unexpected information that would change the confidence value; For example, my funeral is happening at Monday is going to change the confidence whether I survived after the surgery, but it should not be included in the explanation of whether I will survive the surgery. Therefore we have to define "relevant evidence"

(restated below)

**Problem (Irrelevant information)**: I lived to be 31 explains I lived to be 30?

Another problem: tieing explanation to our background knowledge sounds off


**Greater problem**: In some context, some explanation *cannot be* prediction. Therefore, the Hempelian project that prediction=explanation failed. 

For example, John Jones gets paresis because he had untreated syphilis, and 30% chance of syphilis develops paresis, and the only way to get paresis is to have syphilis. But this is not a prediction. 


### Pragmatics of Explanation

what is an explanation? It is an linguistic activity to a conversationally appropriate answer to "why-question"

There are at least 3 ways in which context is relevant to explanation;
1. contrast class ambiguity
2. bg knowledge
3. audience's interest

Contrast class ambiguity:

Compare: 

- why did *Adam* eat the apple? 
- Why did Adam *eat* the apple? 
- Why did Adam eat the *apple*?

Why are you robbing the bank?
Because there's money there

background knowledge:

- Why was there a forest fire? Because oxygen in present
---This is relevant, but not appropriate to mention this in this context

Audience interest:

- Why are you late? you boss is not interest in knowing natural laws when he asks this

What's the *connection* between *ideal explanation* (contextually and pragmatically invariant, corresponds the whole *scientific practice*) and human activity of *explanatory act* (contextually and pragmatically variant, corresponds a *request for explanation*)? Intuitively, there should be some connection.

Pragmatic proponent need to admit that there's something that is explanatory but not appropriate; The idealists need to admit that the ideal account is not straightforwardly the answer in the context.

Scientific realists: tend to think science is aiming at *ideal explanation*

We need to reconcile the two horns when we are trying to come up with a theory of explanation

Anti-realists: tend to think that, we should not think about *ideal explanation*. We should only care about the explanatory act stuff.

Hempel is having some realist idea but only using positivists' tools

**Jeffrey** Explanation is not an argument (Don''t take his term "causal explanation" to imply that there's ontological cause)

Motivation of Hempel: Why he requires high probability is that, or whatever something happens you can explain with the same thing. or example, you can explains you win/lose the lottery with "I bought the lottery." If you want to explain "I win the lottery," The motivation is that, there must be some high probability or deterministic law governing it.
