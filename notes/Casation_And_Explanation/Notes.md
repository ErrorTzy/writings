more obvious way: science tells us entities and properties, therefore, science tells us about the world in itself

less obvious way: distinction between what is the case and what had to be the case. For example, people separate causation and correlation; a scientific law vs. a contingent truth

two tasks: predict (describe before it happens) ...AND explain why (find out laws/causes)

**ampliative argument**: the content of the conclusion goes beyond the content of the premises; Truth-perseving

**erosion proof**: Even if you add a premise (that is coherent with other premises), the conclusion does not change

Personal Probabilities

A wants money --> A goes to bank: we infer that "A believes bank gives A money"

belief/disbelief is a too coarse-grained category; We are more confident in some belief and less in others; So we distribute personal probabilities to beliefs, i.e. degrees of belief/credences

We can measure degrees of belief by behavior


**Argument Strength**: the degree of the confidence a person *should be* if the person is sure of the premises

Example: 
```
P: Katie's life-time free throw average is 73%
---
---[0.73]
C: Katie will have a free throw next time
```


The strength of the conclusion is 73% 

ampliative
- abductive: Cheese is missing --> Mice!
- inductive: rely on the principle that unchecked case will be like the checked cases

Something right about positivism: shitting on Metaphysics&theology
Something wrong about positivism: Metaphysics&theology are nonsense; esp. modal claims should be acceptable

Arch project: Accurately shit on metaphysics and theology but don't shit on electrons and modal propositions

Positivism:
Modal statements (e.g. laws of natural) are reduced to the feature of our language; 
Electrons are reduced to experiences

Positivism failed, but how to save some of their ideas

Van Fraassen: Pro-theology(Kirkegaardian flavor, faith is okay), against metaphysics, pro-small-science
