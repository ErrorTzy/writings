more obvious way: science tells us entities and properties, therefore, science tells us about the world in itself

less obvious way: distinction between what is the case and what had to be the case. For example, people separate causation and correlation; a scientific law vs. a contingent truth

two tasks: predict (describe before it happens) ...AND explain why (find out laws/causes)

**ampliative argument**: the content of the conclusion goes beyond the content of the premises; Truth-perseving

**erosion proof**: Even if you add a premise (that is coherent with other premises), the conclusion does not change

Personal Probabilities

A wants money --> A goes to bank: we infer that "A believes bank gives A money"

belief/disbelief is a too coarse-grained category; We are more confident in some belief and less in others; So we distribute personal probabilities to beliefs, i.e. degrees of belief/credences

We can measure degrees of belief by behavior


**Argument Strength**: the degree of the confidence a person *should be* if the person is sure of the premises

Example: 
```
P: Katie's life-time free throw average is 73%
---
---[0.73]
C: Katie will have a free throw next time
```


The strength of the conclusion is 73% 

ampliative
- abductive: Cheese is missing --> Mice!
- inductive: rely on the principle that unchecked case will be like the checked cases

Something right about positivism: shitting on Metaphysics&theology
Something wrong about positivism: Metaphysics&theology are nonsense; esp. modal claims should be acceptable

Arch project: Accurately shit on metaphysics and theology but don't shit on electrons and modal propositions

Positivism:
Modal statements (e.g. laws of natural) are reduced to the feature of our language; 
Electrons are reduced to experiences

Positivism failed, but how to save some of their ideas

Van Fraassen: Pro-theology(Kirkegaardian flavor, faith is okay), against metaphysics, pro-small-science

### Hempel's program:

reducing explanation to description; positivism-friendly

Scientific explanation should only consists of laws.

You may explain why the length of the shadow in terms of the height of the flag, but it seems off to explain the reason why the flag has height h because it casts certain shadow.


The thing we want to explain: explanandum
The thing explaining: explainan
explainandum + explainan = explanation

Let conclusion be the explanandum and the premises be the explainan.

Hempel's first modal: Deductive-nomological (DN model)

To make your derivation an explanation, the derivation must
- be deductively valid
- include at least one natural law in your premises, and the argument is no longer valid if you remove this natural law.
- All the premises must be true in order to explain.
- All the premises must be empirically verifiable

Asymmetry of explanation: If P explains Q, then Q does not explain P
If we don't restrict ourselves to positivists' toolkit, then we may use causation to explain.
Hempel's answer: this asymmetry is just pragmatic.
Suspicion: pragmatic is enough?

Hempel's second model: inductive-statistical
Motivation: derivation is too deterministic, and no actual science has been successful in predicting just by laws and initial conditions

- be inductively sound
- include at least one (statistical) natural law in your premises, and the argument is no longer sound if you remove this natural law.
- All the premises must be true in order to explain.
- All the premises must be empirically verifiable
- RMS(Requirement of maximal specificity): gist: it is a inductive argument because it is relativized to a background information, or it will be deductive. If there is some unadded information in the background information that would change the confidence value of the conclusion, then you have not yet satisfied RMS.

Problem for RMS: There may be some unexpected information that would change the confidence value; For example, my funeral is happening at Monday is going to change the confidence whether I survived after the surgery, but it should not be included in the explanation of whether I will survive the surgery. Therefore we have to define "relevant evidence"

Another problem: tieing explanation to our background knowledge sounds off
