more obvious way: science tells us entities and properties, therefore, science tells us about the world in itself

less obvious way: distinction between what is the case and what had to be the case. For example, people separate causation and correlation; a scientific law vs. a contingent truth

two tasks: predict (describe before it happens) ...AND explain why (find out laws/causes)
