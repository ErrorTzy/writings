Hempel: deductive inference
Aristotle: demonstrative syllogism

Aristotle's knowledge: Not just simply the fact but of the reasoned fact; Which is just Hempel's explanation.


**Main concern**: some statistical explanation does not have inference feature.

**Core Problem**: one explains in order to impart knowledge of *how* and *why* the phenomenon takes place, but the inference takes the form of a proof that the phenomenon *does* take place.

The following inference is a *prediction that* the weather will turn bad without explaining why

The glass is falling
Whenever the glass falls the weather turns bad
──────
Therefore, the weather will turn bad

On the other hand, the inference both predicts and explains the fact

The glass is falling
Whenever the glass falls the atmospheric pressure is falling
Whenever the atmospheric pressure is falling the weather turns bad
──────
Therefore, the weather will turn bad

Hypothesis: knowledge-that may not be the best way to understand knowledge-why, but not argued here

Example:

To flip a coin $n$ times, there is $1-2^{-n}$ chance of having at least one head. According to Hempel, when $n=1$, the statistical inference is not strong enough to count as an explanation, but when $n=10$, the inference is strong enough to count as an explanation.

But it seems the strength of the explanation of the two cases are the same. A random process seems to be able to explain any outcome it may produce, due to its randomness. Therefore, as long as we can describe the random process itself, we seem to be able to explain it.

Aristotle's "reasoned fact" does not work in a statistical case because there is no reason for the fact: it comes about by chance.
