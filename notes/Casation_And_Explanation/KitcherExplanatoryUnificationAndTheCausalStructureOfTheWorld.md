Unification theory of explanation: Science unifies disparate phenomena.

## 1. Introduction

law-covering model: from Hempel & Oppenheim; modified to accommodate counterexamples.

Purpose of this paper: evaluate the troubles of those models and evaluate their success

### 1.1 Hempel's Accounts

Hempel's DN model:

1. Explanations are arguments
2. conclusion is the phenomenon to be explained
3. there must be at least one law of nature in the premises

To broaden the DN model to accommodate statistical explanation, IS model is later developed

### 1.2 Hempel's Problems

Four types of objections:

1. (Not necessary) No-law explanation (historical narrative)
2. Hard to define "scientific law" from "accidental generalizations" (No emerald has a mass greater than 1000kg)
3. (Not sufficient) Asymmetry cases (flag-pole and its shadow) and irrelevant factors
4. Improbable induction (paresis)

## 2. The Pragmatics of Explanation

**Responding to the first objection**: Distinguish what is said and the ideal explanation; task is to develop a theory of explanatory acts

### 2.1 Van Fraassen's Pragmatics

Why questions are contrastive: "why P" is elliptical for "why P rather than Q"

**Definition (Why-question)**: a why-question is an ordered triple $\langle P_{k}, X, R \rangle$, in which 

1. $P_{k}$ is the topic of the question ("Why $P_{k}$?")
2. $X$ is the contrast class ("Why $P_{k}$ in contrast to *the rest of $X$*?")
3. and $R$ is the relevance relation. (The answer to the question stands in $R$ to $\langle P_{k}, X \rangle$ )

**Definition (Appropriateness)**: The why-question is appropriate only if 

1. $P_{k}$ is true and all members in $X$ are false
2. There is at least one $A$ that bears $R$ to $\langle P_{k}, X \rangle$

**Definition (Validity of question)** A why-question *arises* in a context $K$ iff $K$ ensures the question is appropriate

**Proposition (Rejecting Questions)**: We reject question $Q$ rather than attempting to answer it when it does not arise

###  2.2 Why Pragmatics Is Not Enough

**Proposition**: If we do not restrict the relevant relation $R$, then any true proposition can be an appropriate answer.

**Proof**: Let $A,B$ both be true in context $K$, then in context $K$ when someone asks "Why $B$?" and $X=\{B, -B\}$ and $R=\{\langle A, \langle B, X \rangle \rangle\}$, $A$ will be an appropriate answer.

**Van Fraassen's answer to asymmetry problem**: In some certain context (e. g. The builder intend to build the flag-pole in such a way that the shadow's length is $l$), we can explain the height of the flag-pole by appealing to the shadow's length.

**Objection** This is a different derivation from the original explanation. The explanation should work even without appealing to the builder's intention.

**The contribution of Van Fraassen's work**: how to relate the idealized accounts of explanation to the everyday practice of answering why-questions

### 2.3 Possible Goals for a Theory of Explanation

**The central task (Hempelian Conception)**: to characterize what is the relevant relation; if we could do this, we can tackle the problem of asymmetry and irrelevance at once. Therefore, for Hempelians, we need to define the class of *ideal relevance relations* that occurs in the *ideal why-questions*; And then we develop a theory to connect the actual explanatory act to the ideal explanation.

To achieve the task, it needs to assume that *science has a global methodology* that applies to all science at all time. It can be argued because it is plausible to say science search for understanding/ideal explanation.

## 3. Explanation as Delineation of Causes

Two ways to achieve the purpose: either we introduce causation at the cost of epistemic problems, or we struggle to find some alternative solution to deal with asymmetries

**introducing causation**: To deal with asymmetry; Explanation identify causes

**Problem**: For empiricists, we can only gain causal judgments by identifying law-like regularities. Therefore, the concept of law is prior to causes, and causal notions must either be reduced, or is redundant.
