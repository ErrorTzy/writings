4.2, 4.20, 4.23, and 4.24

**Problem 4.2**. Show that if A and B are countable, so is A ∪ B. To do this, suppose there are surjective functions f : Z+ → A and g : Z+ → B, and define a surjective function h : Z+ → A ∪ B and prove that it is surjective. Also consider the cases where A or B = ∅.




**Problem 4.20**. Show that the set of all sets of pairs of positive integers is uncountable by a reduction argument.

**Problem 4.23**. Let P be the set of functions from the set of positive integers to the set {0}, and let Q be the set of partial functions from the set of positive integers to the set {0}. Show that P is countable and Q is not. (Hint: reduce the problem of enumerating B𝜔 to enumerating Q ).

**Problem 4.24**. Let S be the set of all surjective functions from the set of positive integers to the set {0,1}, i.e., S consists of all surjective f : Z+ → B. Show that S is uncountable.
