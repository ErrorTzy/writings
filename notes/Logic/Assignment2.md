> **Problem 2.3** Show that $\equiv_n$ is an equivalence relation, for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and that $\mathbb{N}/_{\equiv_n}$ has exactly $n$ members.

(i) To show $\equiv_n$ is an equivalence relation, we need to show it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

1. *Reflexivity:* We show that $x \in \mathbb{N},x \equiv_{n} x$:

For any $x \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $x-x=0n$, Therefore,  $x \equiv_{n} x$

2. *Symmetry:* We show that for $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$, if $x \equiv_{n} y$ then $y \equiv_{n} x$:

For any $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$, if we have some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x-y=kn$, there is also a $-k$ such that $y-x=-kn$. Therefore, if $x \equiv_{n} y$ then $y \equiv_{n} x$

3. *Transitive:* We show that for any $x,y,z \in \mathbb{N}$, if $x \equiv_{n} y$ and $x \equiv_{n} z$, then $x \equiv_{n} z$

For any $x,y,z \in \mathbb{N}$, if we have some $k_{1}, k_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x-y=k_{1}n$ and $y-z=k_{2}n$, then we have $x-z=x-y+y-z=(k_{1}-k_{2})n$. Since subtraction is closed on $\mathbb{Z}$, $k_{1}-k_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, if $x \equiv_{n} y$ and $x \equiv_{n} z$, then $x \equiv_{n} z$

Given 1,2,3,  $\equiv_n$ is an equivalence relation.

> **Problem 2.4** If $R$ is a partial order on $A$, then $R- = R \setminus Id_{A}$ is a strict order. Moreover, if $R$ is a linear order, then $Râˆ’$ is a strict linear order.

To show $R^-$ is a strict order, we need to show it is irreflexive, transitive and asymmetric. If we need to show it is a strict linear order, we need to in addition show it is connected. 

- *Irreflexivity:* We prove $R-$ is irreflexive by reductio. 

Assume $R-$ is not irreflexive, by definition $\exists x (x \in A \land R-_{xx})$. Then there would be an instance $a$ that makes this sentence true. Then we have $a \in A \land R-_{aa}$ But $\langle a, a \rangle \in Id_{A}$, which contradicts with $R- = R \setminus Id_{A}$. Therefore, $R-$ is irreflexive.

- *Transitivity:* We show that $(R-_{xy} \land R-_{yz}) \rightarrow R-_{xz}$

Since $R-_{xy} \land R-_{yz}$, we have $R_{xy} \land R_{yz}$, and thereby $R_{xz}$, due to the transitivity of $R$. Then we need to show that $\langle x,z \rangle \notin Id_{A}$. We prove this by reductio.
Assume $\langle x,z \rangle$ in $Id_{A}$, then $x = z$. Then $Ryz = Ryx$. But $R$ is anti-symmetric and $x \neq y$. This follows that we cannot have both $Rxy$ and $Ryx$, contradiction. Therefore $\langle x,z \rangle$ is not in $Id_{A}$.

Given $R_{xz}$ and $\langle x,z \rangle \notin Id_{A}$, we have $R-_{xz}$. Since the consequent follows from the antecedent, the conditional is true. Therefore $R-$ is transitive

- *Asymmetry:* We prove $R-$ is asymmetric by reductio. 

Assume $R-$ is not asymmetric. By definition there is a pair $\langle a,b \rangle (a, b \in A)$ such that $R-_{ab} \land R-_{ba}$. We know $a \neq b$ because $\langle a,b \rangle \notin Id_{A}$. But since $\langle a, b \rangle \in R-$ and $R$ is anti-symmetric, we cannot have $R-_{ab} \land R-_{ba}$. Then the assumption is false. Therefore $R-$ is asymmetric.

- *Moreover clause: Connectivity:* We show that For any $\langle x,y \rangle \in R-$, if $x \neq y$ then $R-_{xy} \lor R-_{yx}$

For any $\langle x,y \rangle \in R-$, we always have $x \neq y$ because $\langle x,y \rangle \notin Id_{A}$. Also since $\langle x,y \rangle \in R-$, $\langle x,y \rangle \in R$. For R is connected, given $x \neq y$ we have $R_{xy} \lor R_{yx}$. Then $R-_{xy} \lor R-_{yx}$. Therefore $R-$ is connected.
