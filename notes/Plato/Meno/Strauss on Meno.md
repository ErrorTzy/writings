Meno as an introduction to political philosophy

political philosophy:
seek for the better and avoid the worse

the open society vs. the great society
many scholars think political philosophy is impossible for it can be reduced to history and science
positivism
scientific knowledge
knows only the facts and cannot distinguish between true and untrue value

Tocqueville
History has decided in favor of democracy

Max Weber against Tocqueville
history is not inevitable, future depends on our decisions, we must leave it unresolved and unsolvable conflict and each of us must make our decision

Strauss
Max Weber implies but never said clearly that one cannot make a case for anything, one can only make a case for SOMETHING which are respectable.

In social science, no case can be made for anybody, value are non-rational preferences, arguments are mere "rationalizations".

Value:
value 
= any object of desire?
= object of choice?

scientific understanding is proceeded upon common sense understanding
political scientists and social scientists talk a lot, but never tell you that they are only concerning human beings, nor are they differentiating human beings from apes on the tree.

an alternative for positivism: historicism
all human thought including scientific thoughts rest on ultimately premises which cannot be validated by human reason and change from epoch from epoch
Collingwood: absolute presuppositions, not susceptible of being validated


philosophy: the good society
Hegel: doctrines are function of the times
there cannot be THE philosophy, there can only be political philosophy of the time
The paradoxical Hegel doctrine: there is an absolute mode incomparable with all other times and Hegel belongs to the absolute the absolute mode.

historical process is not completed and it is not rational and individuals are the sons of the time, epoch or culture; principles cannot claim to possess universal values

political philosophy is impossible, but the history of political philosophy is possible and necessary.

We must reach some understanding of ourselves
Our ideas are derivative from older institutions and older ideas
Therefore we need to do it in a historical approach

Also admitted by positivism

Strauss: study the history of political philosophy in an expectation of restoring the possibility of political philosophy

after a subject is establish, something may be taken to be granted whereas in the moment of its origins it was not taken for granted and its possibility and necessity is to be established.

Plato: pre-scientific understanding of political philosophy to scientific understanding, whereas in Aristotle, political philosophy is already constituted as a science

Socrates as Plato's mouthpiece
Phaedrus: writing is defected; yet Plato's dialogues are free of these defects, saying different things to different people
the necessity governing the writing: the framework is as important as the content
he does not say the same thing to everybody
we need to translate the statements in the dialogue to absolute statements


republic(Book X) -> symposium(Eros) -> Georgias(rhetoric) -> Protagoras(sophist) -> converge in Meno(virtue)
subtitle: on virtue

Husserl's critique of neo-Kantianism
the school of Marburg concerns the analysis of science, but science is not the perfection of ordinary understanding, but a transformation of prescientific understanding. The important thing is how a word is built up by pure consciousness

Heidegger's critique of Husserl
Things that are sensed is not the primarily given thing. It is already abstract, and the primary thing is the thing in use which is such is relative with not only to our perception but our needs. The value predicates belong as much as the facts. It cannot be understood by pure consciousness, but need to be understood by their own man. 

we can see how pre-philosophical thoughts become philosophical thoughts from Plato and Aristotle
