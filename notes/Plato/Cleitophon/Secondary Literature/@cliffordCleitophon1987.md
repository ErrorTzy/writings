# The authenticity of Cleitophon:
Generally it is considered as authentic (see [[@roochnikRiddleCleitophon1984]], [[@blitsSocraticTeachingJustice1985]])

# The affinity of Cleitophon and Republic:
1. The dialogue Cleitophon is the only one, other than the Republic, in which the characters Cleitophon, Socrates, Lysias, and Thrasymachus all appear. 
2. It is also the only dialogue that is named after a character who is also present in the Republic.
3. Cleitophon is the only figure who neither addresses Socrates nor is addressed by him. The Cleitophon depicts the missing confrontation between Cleitophon and Socrates.

# Cleitophon in Republic:
Cleitophon speaks for the city because he thinks what's lawful is just.
Cleitophon speaks not merely for the city, but for Athenians in particular by sneering Polemarchus who is a Chalcedon metic.

>??????

When Thrasymachus spoke of the ruler in the precise speech , he turned from the legal to the artful as the standard for the law. And by spoken thus, he separated from Cleitophon and the latter will no longer defend the former.

# Cleitophon in history
A public man of some importance active from 411 to 405, was known for his advocacy of "ancestral laws" which reconcile between democracy and oligarchy.

He is a close associate of Theramenes. Aristophanes also pairs him with Anytus.



# Cleitophon the dialogue

## [Cleitophon's mimic (407b-e)](Outline_Cleitophon.md#1.1%20Cleitophon's%20mimic%20(407b-e))
It is the real counter-apology that mocks the single-sided accusation
The positive or intrinsic goodness is not mentioned in Socrates' admonition.
Cleitophon thinks justice is an art.

## [Cleitophon's recount (407e-408a)](Outline_Cleitophon#1.2%20Cleitophon's%20recount%20(407e-408a))
transformation in tone: Socrates' exhortation to Cleitophon's recount
from **how to use properties(riches)** properly to justice as an art of **how to use the human soul(lyre)**. Therefore, justice equals wisdom, and reveals the intrinsic good of justice and explains why a wise man would behave justly.

> ???why this infers that justice is wisdom?


**Two problems of Socrates' inference:** 

### Problem 1: One is adept in an art does not follow that he is adept in ruling others
If justice is an art, then:
If the lyre player can play any one lyre well, it does not mean that he can play many of them at once; I know how to use my own eyes to see does not mean that I know how to use others. Yet statesman or judge is like the lyre player who plays many lyres all at once or the man using his body not of his own.

**A possible answer:**
The soul involves understanding both the user and the used, which is the self knowledge. Therefore, the lyre player also knows the nature of lyres which enables him to rule all lyres.

### Problem 2: Ego-centric incentive will cause indifference
If justice is the art of living well, what's the incentive of a just person to benefit others? The art of justice may teach indifference to others or even exploitation to them.

> the answer to the problem from "passing over the rudder" argument. That argument indicates that the wise knows how to live well, and the one who does not *know* how to live should relinquish their thoughts and let the wise the rule them.
> Socrates thinks justice=virtue=wisdom=art?

## [Asking Socrates' disciples (408b-409e)](Outline_Cleitophon#2.1%20Asking%20Socrates'%20disciples%20(408b-409e))

Is virtue the *product* of justice, or is virtue *itself*?
Because justice is considered as an art, like medicine art or gymnastics, virtue as the well being of a soul, like health, but justice as virtue.


Two-folded art:

| The art   | The end of the art | The result of the art |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| carpentry | carpenters         | wooden stuff          |
| medicine  | physicians         | health                |
| justice   | just men           | ?                     |

## [Asking Socrates (410b)](Outline_Cleitophon#2.2%20Asking%20Socrates%20(410b))

To benefit friends and harm enemies

Problem:
what is the good of such art?

## [@cliffordCleitophon1987]'s interpretation: Practicing justice is teaching
The failure to answer Cleitophon's question made some progress in understanding justice.

The result of the art of justice and its end are identical: the product of justice is just man, and practicing justice is teaching

### Reason 1: The Socratics failed to answer the result of justice apart from teaching just men

> This is obviously what Socrates FAILED to do

### Reason 2: Cleitophon ignored the alternative
At first, it comes to light that either justice is virtue, or justice produces virtue. Cleitophon took the latter for granted and ignored the former one.

### Reason 3: Socratics' and Socrates' answer
Justice produces friendship with oneness of mind, which means justice can be reduced to teaching justice. 

@cliffordCleitophon1987
If we see justice as a producer of virtue, then we do not need to seek its product; If we see justice as virtue, then we might be tempted to locate the result of its practice upon our city. Socratics confuses the difference, and the difference of distinguishing knowledge from virtue hints their identity.


> If it's just reduced to teaching then how will justice then different from other arts? If it is reduced to teaching justice, isn't it begging the question?
> 
> The difference means identity? This is not a solid argument.

**Conclusion**:
Justice yields merely agreement but no further result beyond it

> (Arguments pulled out of nowhere):

justice is somewhere between teaching and other arts: like teaching it produces oneness of mind; unlike teaching and similar to arts, it is not simply transmitting knowledge.

### A doubt: If it is wholly reducible to teaching, why it's good?

Justice not only turns someone into a teacher, but also does good like other arts.
Cleitophon first offers gymnastic and medicine in the beginning, but soon give up the former. Yet the analogy of gymnastic could be the key because 

1. it also have no tangible result
2. it necessarily benefit the craftsman (unlike medicine which only benefits the physician when he's sick)

> In Gorgias, gymnastic is also the relevant art for justice.


## Cleitophon in all

serves as a reply to Socrates' Apology because Socrates seems to have confused exhorting the citizens and benefiting citizens and help them have a virtuous life.

### Why Socrates remains silent?
Socrates will only answer what is justice when someone doubt the goodness of justice and the overall human good. For Cleitophon did not mention anything about "good", this dialogue is of low ceiling.

This also indicate that Socrates can never gratify the city because the city needs the justice right away, but Socrates' view is that one can only achieve justice if he choses a philosophical life.
