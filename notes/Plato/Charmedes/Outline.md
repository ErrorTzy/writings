# The Opening (153a-154b):

Socrates, coming back from the battle of Potidaea, went to the wrestling school of Taureaus. 
First people starts to inquire Socrates about the war.
Then Socrates starts to inquire about philosophy, about how things stood with it, about the young whether any among them has become wise or beautiful or both.
Critias suggest Charmides is the most beautiful one.

# Charmides

## Critias' Calling (154c-155b)

Socrates sees Charmides. He is beautiful. Socrates suggests that Charmides should also beautiful in soul.
Critias believes he is also beautiful in soul and calls him, claiming that Socrates can sure his headache.

## Entrance (155c-159b)

Socrates claims that he can cure headache with a kind of lead and an incantation. There is an incantation because:

1. (from good doctors) whenever there is pain in the eye, one must also treat the head; if someone needs to treat the head, then one also need to treat the body.
2. (from Thracian doctors of Zalmoxis, a god) if someone need to treat the body, one also needs to treat the soul.

Critias claims Charmides is noble in soul.
Socrates 'praise' Charmides for being born in both a politician and a poet family. Then he says he needs to test if Charmides really need this incantation.

Socrates asks: Do you have sound-mindedness?

At first, Charmides fell into a dilemma: 

- If he agrees that he understands sound-mindedness, then he is praising himself and making himself onerous;
- If he disagrees that he understands sound-mindedness, then he will give lie to Critias and it is nor appropriate to say such things against oneself.

Socrates: If you have sound-mindedness, then you know what it is. `which is not at all clear why` Then Socrates asks Charmides to give a definition.


## 1st Def: Doing everything decorously and quietly (159b-160e)


**Counterexamples:**

- Regarding the body, it is better for writing teachers write/cithera players play/wrestlers wrestle/â€¦ swiftly.
- Regarding the soul, learning/teaching/recollecting swiftly is better

If someone with sound-mindedness has some behavior, the behavior has to be beautiful. Some decorous and quiet behaviors are not beautiful. It follows that doing decorously and quietly is not sound-mindedness. 

## 2nd Def: Respectfulness (160e-161b)

**Counterargument:**

Homer says respectfulness is not good for needful man. Sound-mindedness is good while respectfulness is not always good. Therefore respectfulness is not sound-mindedness. 

`This is appealing to authority. This is wierd`

## 3rd Def: Doing one's own things (161b-162b)

Socrates' 'misunderstanding': making things that belongs to one's own. `?` 

1. Teaching words both of friends and of enemies. 
2. It cannot for the law be sound-minded if everyone in the city make his own things. 

# Critias

## 1st Def: Waking Good Things

`Why it has to make something? Critias is missing the doing without a product?`

**Counterargument:**

If someone is sound-minded, then he knows sound-mindedness. 

If sound-mindedness means giving what is needed, then a doctor who cures is sound-minded. But this sound-minded doctor does not have to know how it is good. `Socrates is here confuing what is needed and what is good. the "He who does what is needed is sound-minded" is secretly added to the argument`

## 2nd Def: Knowing oneself

Socrates: the ability to know oneself = the knowledge of oneself `?When we say sound-mindedness is something, we are saying that the property of sound-minded is such and such. Someone has the property of knowing oneself means he is able to have knowledge about oneself. The sound-mindedness is the cause and the knowledge is the effect. We should not say the ability to know should also be knowledge, *unless* one assume that ability must come from knowledge`

Socrates: Knowledge of doctoring produces beneficial products. What beneficial product does knowledge of knowing oneself produce?

Critias' response: Some knowledge does not produce product. `Finally he jumps out of the craft analogy`

Socrates: But still all knowledge has "knowledge of". The what is this knowledge of?

Critias' response:
