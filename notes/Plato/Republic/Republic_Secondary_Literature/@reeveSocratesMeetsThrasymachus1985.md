Thrasymachus is consistent, his real definition is "Justice is the advantage of the stronger".

# What is Thrasymachus' real definition?

**Answer**: Justice is the advantage of the stronger

Thrasymachus has three possible definition about justice:

1. Justice is the advantage of the stronger
2. Justice is the good of another
3. Justice is obedience to the law

majority favors 1, recent scholar favors 2, and a few hardy souls favors 3.

3 is not compatible with 1 or 2 because 1 and 3 contradicts to each other when the ruler makes a mistake, and 2 and 3 contradicts to each other when the ruler obeys the law.

> But the ruler does not obey laws, according to Thrasymachus' longest speech. Thus 2 and 3 are not incompatible.

## Eliminating 3: Thrasymachus rejected Cleitophon 

3 is not Thrasymachus' *final* account because Thrasymachus rejected Cleitophon's suggestion.

> Thrasymachus rejected Cleitophon's account because Cleitophon's suggestion implies two premises:
> 
> 	1. Justice is to obey laws, and
> 	2. Justice only seems to be good, but not really good to the ruler.
> 
> By rejecting Cleitophon, Thrasymachus may rightfully accept (1) but reject (2). Thus we cannot say Thrasymachus rejects 3 in his final account.

## Eliminating 2: Thrasymachus' repetition and Socrates' evaluation.

1 is Thrasymachus' definition of justice because there are textual support: 
1. Thrasymachus repeated 1 for five times (339a1-2, 339a3-4, 341a3-4, 343c4, 344c7), but 2 only one time (343c2).
2. Justice become bad because of 1 but not 2. 
3. Among the examples, Thrasymachus does not include rulers but only officials in his second argument.

> Reeve's elimination is not conclusive. Thrasymachus repeats because he thinks it's the better expression for justice. If we take Thrasymachus' strategy as unmasking justice's illusion, then he repeats because it's more striking. People who accept norms can easily accept altruism, so if justice is just the advantage of another, it is just platitude. But the point Thrasymachus wants to make is that justice is NOT what you thought it is. As a sophist that asks others to praise him after his speech, we would not expect Thrasymachus to say something banal. 
> 
> Why justice become bad because of 1? Justice becomes bad, according to Thrasymachus, because it is not advantageous for oneself.
> 
> It is unclear why officials does not count as rulers. 


# Can 1 take challenges?

## Challenge 1: rulers make mistakes

1 meets challenge when a ruler makes a mistake, but Thrasymachus saves the argument by introducing "the ruler in the precise speech". Is this a plausible account? Thrasymachus uses **challenge 2** to respond challenge 1

## Challenge 2: Ruler in the precise speech

**At least Plato agrees with this account.**

Socrates also adopt this view that "No wise man â€¦ is ever error that he is in the precise sense" (340e4-6), and this aligns with his conviction shown in early Platonic dialogue(cf., e.g., Charm., 159cl, 160e6; La., 192c5-7; Pr., 349e3-5, 359e4-7; M., 87e1-3, 89a3), and this is a standalone topic based on platonic understanding about techne. Whether this is plausible is a side problem, what important is Plato adopted this view, and what's important is if this saved Thrasymachus from Socrates' counterexample.

But did this save Thrasymachus' argument?

Reeve thinks that, in the following argument that Thrasymachus provide,

1. In every polis, Rulers declare what they have set down as just.
2. In every polis, justice is the advantage of the Ruler.

(2) cannot be inferred from (1) unless justice consist in C (Justice is obedience to the law). @reeveSocratesMeetsThrasymachus1985 thinks that Thrasymachus infer (2) from (1) because the essence of politics is ideology control, which consist in:

1. To use education to inculcate what kind of social behavior is good
2. Good behavior is just

**Therefore, Thrasymachus is actually advocating a political theory that defines an ideal Polis, and the Ruler in the precise speech is just an ideal model of the ruler in the Polis.**

> Thrasymachus does not care about the best regime. He only cares about the maximization of one's benefit. There is no way when Thrasymachus is talking about the Ruler, he has in mind an ideal state that has a strict ideology control instead of just a perfect tyrant with the notion of how one should live. 
> 
> Also, Thrasymachus' perfect tyrant kidnaps and enslaves subjects. It is hard to believe a perfect tyrant would set down rules that allow anyone to kidnap and enslave others and think it is advantageous to him. Also, it is unbelievable if the tyrant needs to pay tax to himself. Thus, there is little reason to believe Reeve's explanation that 1 restricts 2, and the ruler is just when he does what is advantageous to himself.
> 
> If we follow Reeve's understanding of Thrasymachus' definition, then justice is bad for the subjects and good for the ruler. This might be backed by Callicles' view, which distinguish natural justice and conventional justice. But Glaucon said doing INJUSTICE is naturally good. Thus, it is not sure why the definition of justice should have two meanings when applying to different people. Therefore, it is a worse definition by itself comparing to 2.
> 
> **Thus, 1 restricting 2 is both not supported by text, and philosophically implausible.**

**Conclusion**: "Thrasymachus has produced two powerful and convincing arguments, Socrates five bad ones."

# What's the role of their debate?

Some argue that it is an old dialogue appended to his newly written Republic Book II-X([[@annasIntroductionPlatoRepublic1981]], 16-58; [[@crossPlatoRepublicPhilosophical1971]], 1-60; [[@whiteCompanionPlatoRepublic1979]], 61-73). Reeve objects this view.

## Reason 1: Thrasymachus addresses two Socrates' key method
The twin pillar of the moral theory are the elenchus and the craft analogy [@irwinPlatoMoralTheory1977, Ch.3]. Thrasymachus put both in question.
**Elenchus**: Any proposition refuted does not mean it is false. It can only indicate that the interlocutor does not know how to defend it. Therefore, to discover the truth, one must seek for positive theorizing.
**The craft analogy**: The true beneficial craft is the craft of injustice.
Plato does abandon elenchus and the craft analogy in the rest of Republic, and restricts elenchus (dialectic) to only the ones who have already mastered mathematical science.

> They were talking about the art of ruling, but not virtue.
> Reeve thinks Plato abandoned the craft analogy since then?
