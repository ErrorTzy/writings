## John Locke: real and nominal definitions

**nominal definition**: nominal essence,  “_abstract_ Idea _to which the Name is annexed_ (III.vi.2).”, the essential qualities of gold
eg. a body yellow, of a certain weight, malleable, …

**real definition**: real essence, “the constitution of the insensible parts of that Body, on which those Qualities (mentioned in the nominal essence) and all other Properties of _Gold_ depend (III.vi.2).”
eg. the thing made up from a certain kind of atom in a special order

Perhaps it is helpful to indicate the distinction between real and nominal definitions thus: to discover the real definition of a term X one needs to investigate the thing or things denoted by X; to discover the nominal definition, one needs to investigate the meaning and use of X

## Dictionary definitions

A dictionary definition explains the meaning of a term. It provide definitions that contain sufficient information to impart an understanding of the term.

(It is a fact about us language users that we somehow come to understand and use a potential infinity of sentences containing a term once we are given a certain small amount of information about the term. Exactly how this happens is a large mystery.)

definition sought by philosophers are not the sort found in a dictionary: the explanation of something is very different from the sense in which a dictionary explains the meaning of a word.

## Stipulative definitions

A stipulative definition is a type of definition in which a new or currently existing term is given a new specific meaning for the purposes of argument or discussion in a given context. When the term already exists, this definition may, but does not necessarily, contradict the dictionary (lexical) definition of the term. Because of this, a stipulative definition cannot be "correct" or "incorrect"; it can only differ from other definitions, but it can be useful for its intended purpose.

## Descriptive definitions

Descriptive definitions, like stipulative ones, spell out meaning, but they also aim to be adequate to existing usage.

A definition is _extensionally adequate_ iff there are no actual counterexamples to it; 
it is _intensionally adequate_ iff there are no possible counterexamples to it; 
and it is _sense adequate_ (or _analytic_) iff it endows the defined term with the right sense.

e.g. 
“Water is H2O,” for example, is intensionally adequate because the identity of water and H2O is necessary. But it is not sense-adequate, for the sense of ‘water’ is not at all the same as that of ‘H2O’.
The definition ‘George Washington is the first President of the United States’ is adequate only extensionally but not in the other two grades, while ‘man is a laughing animal’ fails to be adequate in all three grades.
