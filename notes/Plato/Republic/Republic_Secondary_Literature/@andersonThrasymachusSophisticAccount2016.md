# 1. Thrasymachus' view is important but controversial
 Understanding Thrasymachus' view is important because the development of the Republic is based on Thrasymachus' account on justice, yet it is highly disputed. Why? On possible answer is that it is because of the way Thrasymachus speaks, his methodological assumptions he accepts for explanation. Therefore, the topic question is 
 
 > Can Thrasymachus defend that his method is better than Socrates' method?
 
The conclusion is that Thrasymachus uses the method of genealogical unmasking of justice.     



# 2. Is Thrasymachus offering a definition?

**Answer:** Thrasymachus is not concerned with a consistent definition of justice, but concerned with another way to answer about justice.

## Reason 1: There are contradictions in his four definitions
If we read Thrasymachus as offering a definition, we will need to reconcile between his four definitions:
1. Justice is the advantage of the stronger (338c)
2. Each kind of government declare what they sets down to be just (338e)
3. It is just for the ruled to do whatever the rulers command (339d)
4. Justice is the good of another (343c)
1 and 4 are notoriously incompatible when the stronger is acting in accordance with his own advantage. 

## Reason 2: Thrasymachus disagree with Socrates' questioning

Thrasymachus thinks Socrates' elenchus is not a proper method for discovering the truth about justice (in 336c). Therefore, we can infer that Thrasymachus has his own ideas about what would be productive. 

## Reason 3: Opposition to the analogy of math

[[@weltonThrasymachusVsSocrates2006]], pp.293-305: Thrasymachus object to the analogy that the definition of justice is like the definition of 12. This is because Thrasymachus does not thing the definition of justice is not objective and unchanging like mathematical truth. Instead, he thinks that it varies from city to city. 



# 3. What is Thrasymachus' method? 

**Answer:** genealogical unmasking

## Answer 1: Empirical and descriptive account

A recent attempt interpret Thrasymachus as offering an empirical and descriptive account instead of a normative or analytic definition [[@chappellVirtuesThrasymachus1993]][[@santasMethodsReasoningJustice2006]][[@whiteThrasymachusDiplomat1995]][[@barneyCalliclesThrasymachus2017]].

### Reason 1: Historically, Thrasymachus is familiar with politics

Thrasymachus is historically active in political affairs as an envoy [[@tellPlatoCounterfeitSophists2011]], pp. 84-92; [[@whiteThrasymachusDiplomat1995]]; The dramatic setting supports this reason because the conversation took place in Piraeus during the Peloponnesian War, thus one would expect envoys to come to Athens. Therefore, he has access to the data for empirical or sociological generalization.

> This is obviously not a sufficient reason. A stronger claim would be "Historically, Thrasymachus did advocate this account about justice", yet no historical information support this claim.


### Reason 2: Thrasymachus makes empirical claims

According to his initial account, he states two empirical claims: 

1. The rulers of the city are called stronger.
2. The rulers declare what they set down as being just.

And in his longest speech, he displays some empirical observation that supports the idea that just always get less. 

## Response to answer 1: This answer is plausible but not sufficient

Thrasymachus is also offering prudential conclusions about how should one live ones life.

> In deed he has his view, but it is not necessary that he is prudent about it.

### Reason 1: Thrasymachus' exemplary tyrant

Thrasymachus offers the conclusion that injustice is stronger, freer and more masterly than justice on a larger scale and puts up a model of "injustice entire".

> How is this prudential?

### Reason 2: Glaucon and Adeimantus's restatement of Thrasymachus' account is related to Socrates' most important question

> How is this prudential? It can just be a popular opinion.

### Reason 3: Thrasymachus is confident about his empirical account

> He can be ignorant about himself while being confident.

## Answer 2: Genealogical unmasking

### Reason 1: it is a historically popular view by the sophists
Plato thus must have been familiar with these argument and intentionally presented Thrasymachus' argument.

#### Prodicus on religion and the gods
People deify people that provides benefits for their life, and therefore the gods came into being. (Philodemus' *On Piety* (1, fr. 19.519-41); [[@mayhewProdicusSophistTexts2011a]], pp.180-181&The choice of Heracles, pp. 202-226)
Listeners can still have good reason to adhere to customary practices, and thus this will not lead to the conclusion that we *should not* believe in gods (on the contrary, we can become gods like Heracles). However, it does opens up possibilities, especially for those who think we should behave according to the codes that are said to be set down by the gods.

#### Critias on religion and the gods
the gods were the political invention of some wise man in order to control people's lawless behavior (DK 25).[^1]

#### Antiphon on the historical development about justice
[[@antiphonAntiphonSophistFragments2010]], 53-67

### Reason 2: Thrasymachus' account resembles Prodicus' account
Both have a implicit view on how one should live as well as a paradigmatic example of an admirable man (Heracles and the perfect tyrant). 

### Reason 3: Glaucon's restatement is a real genealogical account 



# 4. What is the advantage of using genealogical unmasking?

## Advantage 1: for self-protection
Arguing these claims could be dangerous.

## Advantage 2: opens up new possibilities
It also forces people to question their presuppositions that are taken for granted. It is not trivial because Hesiod is advocating a view of justice based on profitable consequence. Cephalus, Polemarchus, Socrates and the many, by Glaucon and Adeimantus' account is echoing similar view. Thrasymachus is revealing that it is wrong to believe justice can be rewarding. 

## Advantage 3: make non-universal claims
Genealogy unmasking can only be appreciated by a limited number of people; Thrasymachus' account, as well as Critias' account on how gods come to being also can only apply to a small amount of people, or the society will collapse and be reduced to chaos.


# 5. How to understand the substance of Thrasymachus' account of justice?

They are "for-the-most-part" truths, and Thrasymachus acknowledge many possible exceptions to these claims. The just person always at disadvantage unless he gets the luck.

> Do Thrasymachus really acknowledge these exceptions?

His conflicting accounts is actually asking us to see justice from different perspective.
