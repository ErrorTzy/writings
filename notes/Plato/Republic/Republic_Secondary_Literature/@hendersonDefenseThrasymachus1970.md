# 1. The consistent view of Thrasymachus
## 1.1 The essential property of justice

 [[@crossPlatoRepublicPhilosophical1971]] : Every time anyone acts justly, the consequence of such acts will be in the form of some benefit or profit to the strong man

This view leads to contradictory: "justice is the advantage of the stronger" and "justice is the good and another" contradicts when the stronger act in accordance with his own good, because it is just according to the first definition and unjust according to the second.

**Henderson:** "If one person (or group) acts justly, toward another or others, the very act of justice renders the just agent vulnerable and susceptible to being unjustly exploited; that is, to being taken advantage of"

This view eliminates the contradiction. When the stronger act in accordance with his own good, he exploit the others instead of providing vulnerability for the stronger to exploit. Therefore when the stronger act in accordance with his own good, he is not acting for the advantage of the stronger, according to Henderson's interpretation.

The difference between **Cross and Woozley**'s perspective and **Henderson**'s perspective lies in that the former deems just actions will necessarily cause the advantage of the stronger (causal consequence), and the latter consider just actions themselves are the advantage of the stronger (logical consequence).

> But just action does not necessarily render the possibility of being exploited?


## 1.2 The strong, the unjust and the ruler
The strong men are those who are able to seize the opportunities of exploiting the just people and get away with it

The unjust men are those who do unjust things, including pickpockets, cutpurses, etc.

The rulers in the strict sense are those who set down the laws to the rulers' advantage, and according to Henderson's interpretation, the just laws, since "the laws to the ruler's advantage" means making people vulnerable to exploitation. **The just rulers and the unjust rulers will set down the same laws and both advocate justice**, according to Henderson.

# 2. Socrates' argument failed completely to refute

Contradicting to **Cross and Woozley**, Thrasymachus has done well not adopting Cleitophon's suggestion or he would be inconsistent in that Cleitophon's definition of justice is essentially obeying the law.

Thrasymachus' precise speech is well-argued because he is distinguishing the artist as a practical role and the artist as a human.  (a potential problem: the practical role of a patient)

Socrates' argument:
1. parallel argument
Even if it's plausible, Thrasymachus can still argue that his ruler does not need to take the role as a ruler, but as a strategist and a unparalleled grafter.

The reason why Thrasymachus accepted this may be that Plato accepted a suppressed premise that someone deviates from perfection only because he is ignorant. But the premise is implausible because someone may deviate from perfection not because of ignorance, but because of other purposes.

2. invalid conclusion
The art of torture, and many other counterexamples shows that Socrates generalization is invalid. Henderson argues that Socrates can go as far as to say every art must have a subject.
