1. What contribution does book 1 make to Republic as a whole? Note that 
	1. its style is quite different, being closer to the earlier, aporetic dialogues, and 
	2. Socrates’ main interlocutor, Thrasymachus, has a very different temperament than his interlocutors in books 2–10, Glaucon and Adeimantus. (Scott’s article, reading 5, is very helpful on this.) 

2. Is Thrasymachus advancing one consistent definition of justice, or two conflicting ones? How does his ideas of justice and injustice compare with Callicles’? What do the disagreements between Socrates and Thrasymachus reveal about their respective understandings of, on the one hand, justice and, on the other, advantage or benefit? Pay close attention to Socrates’ argument concerning the function of the soul at 352d–354a—what kind of view of virtue and justice does this suggest? 

3. Why is Glaucon dissatisfied with Socrates’ response to Thrasymachus? In what ways does he ‘renew the challenge of Thrasymachus’ and in what ways is the challenge he and Adeimantus pose different from Thrasymachus’? 

4. What are Glaucon’s three classes of goods? Be sure that you can define each class carefully, and explain for each of the examples given in the text why it counts as an example of the relevant kind of good. Why is this division important for Glaucon’s challenge to Socrates? Why does Socrates put justice in the second category, and conventional morality put it in the third? What do Glaucon and Adeimantus mean when they say they want to hear justice praised ‘by itself ’?
