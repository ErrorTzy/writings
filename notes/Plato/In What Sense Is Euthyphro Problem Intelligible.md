In the *Euthyphro*, Plato posed a famous dilemma that has puzzled philosophers for thousands of years: "Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?"

The question I want to raise here is not whether this particular formulation is intelligible. Clearly, there are complications involving the concepts used. Rather, my interest is whether this *type* of question itself is intelligible.

You might immediately ask: What exactly do I mean by "this type of question"? Specifically, I am interested in whether the following form of question is intelligible:

- "Is $P$ because $Q$, or $Q$ because $P$?", where:
    1. $P$ is equivalent to Q in all possible worlds, and
    2. $P$ seems to explain $Q$, or $Q$ seems to explain $P$ (or both).

Here are some examples of such questions:

1. Does *the table exist* because *all its parts exist*, or do *all its parts exist* because *the table exists*?
2. Is "*x is a dog or a table*" true because "*x is a dog*" is true or "*x is a table*" is true, or is "*x is a dog*" is true or "*x is a table*" is true because "*x is a dog or a table*" is true?

To simplify the analysis of Plato’s original question, I'll set aside certain complexities. There are two confusing concepts involved in the original dilemma: *piety* and *god*. For illustrative purposes, I'll adopt the following interpretation. (I believe textual evidence supports it, but my point doesn't hinge on its precise accuracy):

- A god is a hyper-rational, all-knowing being. By "hyper-rational," I mean its reasoning process is perfectly infallible and rational. Combined with "all-knowing", this means that once the state of the world is fixed, the god knows everything correctly.
- God loves what is moral (or just).
- Piety is equivalent to morality (or justice).

By clarifying these concepts, we explains away the complexities related to divine command theory. Now we reframe Plato’s original dilemma into a question about constructivism:

3. Is *an action just* because *some reasoning process determines that it is just*, or *does that reasoning process determine that it is just* because *the action is already just*?

Notice some important feature of this type of questions ("Is $P$ because $Q$, or $Q$ because $P$?"). First, $P$ and $Q$ are synchronic, unlike causation (in the contemporary sense of causation). Once you obtain either of $P$ or $Q$, the other one is immediately true. This is different from the causation. An example of causation would be: "*I dropped the ball* causes *the ball falls*". There is a temporal order in these two facts: ball-dropping happens before the falling.

One attempt to analyze away this kind of problem is to adopt the concept of "seeing-as" (or Aristotle's "qua"). We are talking about some identical facts, but *see* them *as* different facts. Therefore, we can see a thing as *a table*, or we can see this thing as *its tabletop and its legs*. Eventually we are talking about how we see this thing. There's no sense to say which way of seeing it would be more fundamental or ontologically prior.

But obviously this does not explain some intuition here. The object seen-as-tabletop-and-legs seems more "basic" than the object seen-as-table. And the object seen-as-many-atoms is yet more "basic" than the object seen-as-tabletop-and-legs. We see this kind of intuition in Aristotle's analysis of form and matter: a table consists *the form of a table* and its *matter*, e.g. wood. And again wood has its form, say wood-form and its matter, e.g. wood cells. Therefore, it seems if we adopt the "seeing-as" strategy, the intuition about "construction order" is left unexplained. In other words, we can't yet explain why some "seeing-as" is at some "higher-level" which is built up from "lower-level seeing-as".
