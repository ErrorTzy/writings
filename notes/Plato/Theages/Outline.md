# 1. Opening(121a-122d)

## 1.1 The difficulty of educating children(121b-d)
the course of growing are similar for living things: it is easy to prepare for bringing it into being or to bring it into being, but vexatious to tend to it.

> Education is not a natural process, but a divine one. People naturally have the need to be educated, but the answer to the need is not given by nature. Education itself seems to follow the pattern of technique.

## 1.2 Demodocus' worry over Theages' demand (121d-122b)

Theages wants to become wise (σοφὸς γενέσθαι) because he is perturbed (διαταράσσω) by **recounting** certain discussions; 

Demodocus think this is risky, but not being able to placate, he give in and decide to counsel Socrates.

## 1.3 Socrates' demand for discussion (122b-d)
- Frist demand: 
Socrates and Demodocus should be on the same page about what exactly Demodocus wants to counsel.

- Second demand: 
Socrates, Demodocus, and Theages should all be on the same page, thus Socrates needs to talk to Theages himself to see what is his desire.


# 2. What is Theages' desire? (122e-125a)

## 2.1 The first attempt: wisdom (123a-c)
If Theages wants to learn the wisdom by which human beings pilot ships, the name of which he want is the piloting art.
If Theages wants to learn the wisdom by which human beings pilot chariots, the name of which he want is the charioteer's art.

Theages agrees that what he want has a name, but says "wisdom(σοφίαν)"



## 2.2 he second attempt: to rule human beings (123d-e)

Charioteer's art rules chariots.
Piloting art rules ships.
What Theages want to **rule**?

Theages says to rule "human beings"

## 2.3 The third attempt: to rule all the people in the city (123e-124b)

Medical art rules sick people
Musical art rules singers in choruses
Gymnastic art rules those who are exercising
Farming art rules reapers and harvesters, etc.

> Farming art rules plants or reapers?

Theages wants to rule all the craftsmen, public or private, man or woman.

## 2.4 The fourth attempt: to be a wise tyrant (124c-125a)

> This may lead from the question that what kind of rule does Theages want. But mostly Theages is half-tricked into this conclusion that he wants to be a tyrant.

Theages accepted the examples Socrates illustrates: Aegisthus who killed Agamemnon, Peleus the son of Aeacus who ruled in Phthia, Periander the son of Cypselus who ruled in Corinth, Archelaus the con of Perdiccas who ruled in Macedonia, Hippias the son of Peisistratus who ruled in Athens.

those who make prophecies are called soothsayers, and the people Socrates illustrates are called tyrants.

### 2.4.1 What kind of wise people do tyrants become tyrants by keep company with? (125b-125e)

Farmers are wise through keeping company with the wise in the art of farming;
Cooks are wise through keeping company with the wise in the art of cooking;

Theages don't know tyrants are wise through keeping company with the wise in what.

## 2.5 The fifth attempt: rule in the manner of those who have a good repute (126a)

Theages says that he would pray to be a tyrant, but this is not what he desires. What he desires is to rule in the manner of the other man in the city who are in good repute.

### Going back to 2.4.1: to whom one should consort?(126b-127a)

Theages is familiar with the Socratic argument that those who versed in political affairs cannot teach political art.
But Socrates says Theages is disesteeming the craftsmen and recommend him to consort with those gentlemen who are versed in the things pertaining to political affairs.

> Why Socrates contradicts to his own argument?

# 3. Why Socrates refuse to give education to Theages? (127a-)

Theages and Demodocus beseech Socrates to company with Theages.

## 3.1 Reason 1: Socrates only knows erotic love (127d-128b)

Demodocus is better than him because Demodocus is older and has more experience in political affairs;
There are Prodicus, Gorgias, Polus and many others who claim to be capable of teaching politics;
Socrates only knows erotic love.

## 3.2 Reason 2: Socrates has a "voice" that prevents him from doing things (128d-129e)

The voice always signals Socrates to turn away from what he's going to do but never urges on.

Examples:
	Charmides
	Cleitomachus
	Sicily expedition
	Sannion

## 3.3 Reason 3: Even the voice does not prevent, his effect on interlocutors may fade away quickly (129e-130e)

As long as they spend with Socrates, they make amazing progress. But when they go away, they are once again no different from anyone. 

Example:
	Aristides
