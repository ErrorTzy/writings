# 1. Prologue/Introduction <447a-449a>

# 2. The Arguments with Self-Contradiction as the Criterion of Refutation.

## 2.1. Gorgias (Persuasion) <449a-461b>

### 2.1.1. Art and Rhetoric <449a-454b> (Defining rhetoric)

#### 2.1.1.1 Method of Rhetoric: speech but other arts use speech

  - Arts and crafts are about something, so what is rhetoric about?

#### 2.1.1.2 Subject Matter of Rhetoric:

  - The greatest of things in human affairs and the best <451d>
    - Power and persuasion
    - Public persuasion of the multitude
    - But some examples: health: doctor / beauty: trainer / wealth: moneymaker

#### 2.1.1.3 Rhetor is a craftsman/artist of persuasion <453a>

  - But this is inadequate since other arts persuade, e.g. teaching numbers, painting, etc.
  - What kind of persuasion? with or without knowledge?
  - Concern is with belief, not right or wrong.

### 2.1.2. Rhetoric, Art, and Justice <454b-461b>

#### 2.1.2.1. Rhetoric does not teach justice or injustice, right or wrong <455a>

- Implications:
  - Themistocles and the shipyards: the power of rhetoric
  - Doctor and patient
- Gorgias can persuade better than a professional

#### 2.1.2.2. Goals and Methods.

- Gorgias: teacher not responsible for student
- Methods and Goals of Gorgias vs. Methods and Goals of Soc. <456b-458c>

#### 2.1.2.3. Rhetoric, knowledge, and justice.
- Rhetoric without knowledge persuades the ignorant <459>
- Gorgias would teach justice if a student did not know it <460a>
- Socrates: the teacher then must be responsible for the student! The rhetor must be just!

## 2.2. Polus (power) <461b-488b>

### 2.2.1. Rhetoric, art, pleasure <461b-466a>
- Polus: Soc. is impolite. Gorgias just said out of modesty that he could not teach justice.
- Actually a sham refutation acc. to Polus.
- But note that rhetoric was exposed for what it really is: persuasion on any topic, especially of those people who do not know, not of those who do know.
- Soc.: Rhetoric is no craft or art at all but a knack!
	- What does a knack do? Produces pleasure and gratification
	- How? By flattery in any way whatsoever!
	- Examples and analogies:
		- Cookery................medicine
		- cosmetics..............gymnastic
		- sophistic..............legislation
		- rhetoric...............justice
		- Seeming.................Being
		- Appearance..............Reality
  - Why is rhetoric not an art? "because it is unable to render any account (logos) of the nature of the method of justice.
	- Seeming.................Being
	- Appearance..............Reality
  - Why is rhetoric not an art? "because it is unable to render any account (logos) of the nature of the method and the good are NOT coextensive: In fact, rhetoricians and tyrants have the least power. They do as they think but not as they really want.
  - Drugs and medicines
  - Ends and means: intermediate and ultimate goods
  - ALL SEEK THE GOOD.
  - Intelligence is required, and that is the intelligence of what the human person is and
  of what is truly to the benefit of the human person!

### 2.2.2. Justice and the benefit or good of the agent/doer <468e-481b>

#### 2.2.2.1. Doing and Suffering Injustice <468e-474b>
- (Notice Polus' attempt at trickery in the argument at 469a10)
- Doing injustice is the greatest of evils
- Better to suffer injustice than to do it
- What is a tyrant?
- Restraint by fear of punishment <470a5>
- Hint: Is the whole of happiness merely education and justice? <470e>
- Example of Archelaus, who is most unjust and most happy, according to Polus.
- Polus' refutation by example of Archelaus.
- What is happiness? <471>
- Polus' accuses Soc. of bad faith <471e>
- Soc.'s response: "the matters we are discussing are by no means trivial; rather, they are practically the very ones which to know is noblest and not to know is most disgraceful: the sum and substance of them is to recognize or fail to recognize who is happy and who is not." <472c-d>
- Soc.: more wretched if not punished, less wretched if pay justice
- Polus: that's outrageous. Example of (Job-like) tortured man and tyrant
- No refutation by laughter or democratic vote!
- All persons would choose to suffer injustice rather than to do it!

#### 2.2.2.2. A New Start. <474b-476a>
- Polus: worse to suffer injustice than to do it beautiful things and beauty
- KEY: 474c: Soc: which is uglier (more shameful), to do or to suffer wrong?
- Pol: to do wrong
**Polus is still under the sway of conventional morality**
- 475: uglier by surpassing in (a) pain (no) or (b) evil
- 475c-d: Soc: So then it is by excess of evil that doing wrong must be worse than suffering it!
  Worse, therefore more evil!

#### 2.2.2.3. Justice, punishment and the good of the soul <476a-479e>
- "whether for the wrongdoer to be punished is the greatest of evils"
- Transitivity: he who punishes justly, carries out a just action on the patient
- 477a5: a man brought to justice suffers what is good and is benefited!
  - Rid soul of evil, the greatest evil!
- 479c-d: injustice and doing injustice is the greatest evil!

#### 2.2.2.4. Benefits of Rhetoric <479e-481b>
   ((Soc. calls it discordant))

#### 2.3.2.1. Refutation of Callicles <486b-491c>

- Each should be ruler over himself

#### 2.3.2.2. Desire, temperance and the agent's good <491d-494a>
- Full with passions
- Jar with holes, sieve in our souls

#### 2.3.2.3. Hedonism and self-indulgent life <494a-495d>
- The pleasant and the good are the same

#### 2.3.2.4. First Argument vs. Hedonism: good does not equal pleasure <495e-497d>
- Drinking and thirst, hunger and satiety

#### 2.3.2.5. Second Argument vs. Hedonism <497d-499b>
- Coward and brave man in combat and retreat
