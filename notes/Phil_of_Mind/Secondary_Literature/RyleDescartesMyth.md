# The official doctrine
There is a body and a mind;

| mind                                       | body                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| in time, not in space                      | in space and time            |
| does not obey mechanical laws              | obeys mechanical laws        |
| "internal"                                 | "external"                   |
| private                                    | public                       |
| does not interact with each other          | interact each other in space |
| direct, distinct and undoubtable knowledge | doubtable                    |

corollaries

- the problem of other minds: you cannot access other minds
- the words "knowing/believing/..." denotes stream of consciousness; but it is logically impossible to denote other's consciousness

# The Absurdity of the official doctrine

What is a category mistake? The false counterpart, assuming that they are of the same logical type

- University vs. library, college, lab
- march-past vs. battalions, squadrons
- team-spirit vs. bowlers, batsmen, fielders
- average taxpayer vs. John Doe

# The origin of the category mistake

Trying to escape from mechanical determinism: A para-mechanical process

- not mechanical process but mental process
- not mechanical laws but mental laws

mind is a non-machine, a spectral machine --> The problem of free will vs. mental law

**Descartes' mistake:**
converting "What's the difference between intelligent and non-intelligent conduct" into "Given the casual principle of the body, what's the casual principle of intelligent conduct"?
