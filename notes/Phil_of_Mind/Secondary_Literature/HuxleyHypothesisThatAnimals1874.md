On the Hypothesis That Animals Are Automata, and Its History (Epiphenomenalism)

# Descartes' arguments

Animals are machine like sleeping human because even we human has unconditioned movements.

As mentioned in the fifth part of the Discourse of Method , there is no other principle of motion than the organs that is responsible for the motion of animals.

Problem: Where are the evidences?

# Experiment outcome

The consciousness is intact even if the spinal cord is destroyed, but if the anterior division of the brain is damaged, then the consciousness is abolished. 

## Human example

1. When a man's feet is tickled, the leg would be drawn up. This "draw up" seems purposive, but does not involve consciousness.
2. A sergeant F has periodical disturbance of brain function, during which the he only has a sense of touching. But he behaves mainly normal. Is he conscious in this state?    

> Purposive movement vs. consciousness

## Frog example

1. A frog can Lift up the limb and rub the acid if it is *headless*. If the limb is held, it will use another limb and rub the acid
2. Swim in the water with 2/3 brain removed, when it is completely devoid of spontaneity
3. Keep full bodily function(including swallowing) without the 'optic lobe', although it will not move itself. It can even avoid obstacle, even if it is theoretically blind.

This behavior *seems* purposive, but the frog is *unlikely* to be sensitive.

Therefore, *it is possible* for frogs to be automata.

> But we can still say that the frog is only **REPONSIVE**, but not **VULUNTARY**.

# Huxley's arguments

Doctrine of continuity: why consciousness suddenly appears in human?

But animals are still automata. 

The causal relationship does not work (Epiphenomenalism)

Analogy of "fog from a train"
