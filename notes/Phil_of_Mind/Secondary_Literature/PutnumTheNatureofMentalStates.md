# "Are pains brain states?"


## Negative Defense `?`

### Traditional identity rules

When answering similar identity questions, analytical philosophy has two presuppositions:

1. Being A = being B ↔ the meaning of A = the meaning of B
2. Being A is being B is informative only when it is reductive `i.e. A can be reduced to B`

\<Technical\> Definition of terms:

- Property: predicates or functors
- Concept: The concept of x can identify x, but is not x

> Frege's distinction between sense and reference?

Two questions:

1. What counts as an answer when asking "what is the concept of x"?
2. What counts as an answer when asking "what is the property x"?

### Property = Concept

Refuting Carnap, Meaning and Necessity: property = concept

\<Example\>: Temperature is mean molecular kinetic energy, but the *concept* of temperature is not the *concept* of kinetic energy.

> What's Carnap's argument?

Now property ≠ concept, then we can refute that:

- Pain is not brain states, because I know I'm in pain, but I don't know what kind of brain state I am in.

This is not a valid argument because the concept of pain is different from the concept of brain-state does not prevent pain from being brain-state.

> Evaluation: Make sense to me


### Spacial-temporal Difference

pain is not brain-state because identity must entail the same spacial-temporal region. But pain is in the arm while brain-state is in brain.

*REF*: Mirror image seems to locate behind mirror. Similarly, the Pain seems to locate in the arm but it can be actually in the brain

> It seems that Putnum is saying that, with some biological explanation, we can say that pain is in fact also in the brain.
> Evaluation: But is this possible at all? By what evidence can we say that 'pain is in fact in the brain' without accepting that pain is brain-state?

### Correlation not identity

It will be troublesome to explain how they are correlated and what is mental entity.

> Evaluation: This is only a methodological preference that, without *more reasons*, we should say two things are identical if they are correlated.
> But of course pain is subjective experience and brain-state is objective phenomenon. Then what counts as "more reasons"?
> Putnum's theory here is arguing that despite "subjective-objective" distinction, there still can be an identity.

The traditional way: if to say 'pain is brain-state' changes the meaning of 'pain', then 'pain is brain-state' is wrong

Putnum: this 'change of meaning' criterion is wrong. We should abandon the 'meaning' talk. 


## Positive Defense

What pain **is** requires speculative empirical theory construction. 

This is sensible because the purpose of philosophy is to give hypothesis.

> This is not plausible, but let's accept it for the sake of argument

\<Technical\> 

**Probabilistic Automaton:**

- Similar to Turing Machine, but the transition between the states are not *deterministic* but *probabilistic*. 

**Description:**

True statement of a system that, S has several related but distinct states, and these states are related to motor output.

> Description means 'structure of functions?'

\<Technical\>

### Hypothesis

1. All organisms capable of feeling pain are probabilistic automata
2. Every organism capable of feeling pain possesses at least one description of a certain kind 
3. No organism capable of feeling pain possesses a decomposition into parts which separately possesses Description of the kind referred to in (2)
4. For every Description of the kind referred to in (2), there exists a subset of the sensory inputs such that an organism with that Description is in pain when and only when some of its sensory inputs are in that subset

For more description on what Functional Organization is needed, and what marks the sensory inputs as pain, see "The Mental Life of Some Machine".

Hypothesis 3 is to rule out 'swarms of bees' as single pain-feelers.

> Why can't a swarm of bee have consciousness?

Hypothesis 1 is redundant, since everything can be a Probabilistic Automaton under some Description.

> From 2 we can deduct 1? How can we understand 'some Description'?


### FS vs. Brain State

Brain-state theorists are talking about the physical-chemical states `but not functional states` because:

#### Difference

1. It's the only states that they mentioned, and
2. they claim that brain-state theory is incompatible with dualism, while *functional states are compatible with dualism, as long as the body and could together forms a Probabilistic Automaton*.
3. `?` brain-state theory only assumes physical properties, while *functionalism does not have any metaphysical assumption*
4. If 'states' is not specified as physical-chemical states, then this claim is empty until it is specified.

#### BS' Success Condition

If a brain-state theory is plausible, then the theorists must find out **ONE** physical-chemical state so that **ANY** organisms that has this state must has pain, any any organisms that cannot produce this state **CANNOT** have pain. 

#### Counterarguments

##### Extraterrestrial Life

If we found a extraterrestrial life that produce this state of brain, we must immediately say that the extraterrestrial life has pain.

> This counterexample seems not powerful enough.

##### Diversity of Life

Since there are so many life forms on the earth can `?` have pain, it is *possible but unlikely* to have the same physical-chemical state.

> This counterexample is only saying it's unlikely.

##### Fragility from counterexamples

It can be easily refuted as long as we found one mental state in different creatures that has different physical-chemical state.

> Does brain-state theorists has to assume that different creatures has the same physical-chemical state for a mental state? Or can we even say a bat can have exactly the feeling of pain as I have?

#### Why FS is better

##### FS is Weaker

Weaker than brain-state theory because it only supposes Functional Organization, but not physical-chemical details.

When psychology wants to develop a species-independent theory, functional state theory is more reasonable (because it is weaker) than brain theory.

> This only proves functionalism as a **weaker** claim than physical-chemical state theory. It does not make it truer.

### FS vs. Behavior Disposition

#### Advantage of BD

This is how we verify mental states.

##### Problem

How we verify A has nothing to do with A itself.

If we think A is the verification of A, then it would be **false** to say 'Heat is the kinetic energy' because people do not verify heat as kinetic energy.

> It seems to have another metaphysical assumption? Like we remove the sense-reference distinction?

#### Difficulty of BD

##### Circular Definition

Behavior Disposition theory cannot define pain behaviors, except defining them as 'the behaviors of X as if X were in pain', which is circular. On the other hand, *functionalism can define pain by Functional Organization without using the notion of pain*

##### Behaviorless Pain

If the behaviors are peripheral behaviors, then it is false because two animals with motor nerves cut will have the same behavior, but if we have one's pain nerve cut, then one will feel pain while the other won't.

##### Theoretical Preference

We wish to *explain* the mental state behind the behaviors. If everything being equal, we should pick the explanation, not taking the behavior as mental state.

## Methodological Preference `?`

- psychological states can be derived from functional states.
- functional states is not correlated but explains the behaviors
- Excluding 'senseless' questions like what caused pain to correlated with functional states

> initial state + input state → individual inner state → output
> "function" is this abstract if-then structure; it only asserts the RELATIONSHIP between these endpoints, but do not assert anything about the metaphysical attributes of these endpoints
> A stronger version: not only computative function, but causal
>>> Why it's stronger? Why computative can be not causal?
> advantage: it is universal; different individual/species can be explained by the same structure (one function, different implements)
