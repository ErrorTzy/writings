# 1. Dualism and its problems

historical background:
The physical world seems to be well explained by Galileo and Newton

Plato and Aristotle: the dominance of form over matter

the mind vs. the "atom"

Descartes ad his Meditations on First Philosophy:

1. First Meditation: What can be called into doubt
2. Second Meditation: The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than the body
3. Third Meditation: The existence of God
4. Fourth Meditation: Truth and falsity
5. Fifth Meditation: The essence of material things, and the existence of God considered a second time
6. Sixth Meditation: The existence of material things, and the real distinction between mind and body

core concept: "certainty". What is this?
"certainty" is a state of mind, not a property of thing

## Second Meditation

### Arg 1: Universal Doubt

As long as the devil is deceiving me, I am not nothing
Therefore the *proposition* **"I think I exist"** is necessary true

Only when I am thinking about the devil, I can be certain that I exist. It is not that the inference structure that "I think, therefore I am"

#### Another version: Discourse on the Method

To assume the state of dream, what can be certain?
Inference structure: "I think, *therefore* I am"

The "devil" is (at least should) not a metaphysical existence, only a tool

### What am I: New method

**what come into my thought spontaneously and quite naturally** whenever I used to consider what I was

**Criticism:**

Why I am either a body or a soul or both? Can there be counterpart, or can there be alternative?

**The existence of body** cannot pass the methodology of doubt, while **the existence of mind** can

I am a thinking **thing** --> makes Descartes a substantial dualist

## Sixth Meditation

Cartesian Circle: I exist therefore god exists, god exists therefore I exist

### Arg 2: The conceivability argument

modern argument: philosophy zombies

I can clearly understand one thing apart from another, then the two things are distinct, *at least by God*.

The body of a man is a kind of machine made up from bones, nerves, etc and has movement without mind

**Reconstruction:**

I can conceive my mind and my body coming apart
Therefore, it is possible for my mind to be separated from my body
Thus, my mind and my body are different


**Criticism:**
basic structure: conceive -> concept -> metaphysical
Why would the activity of mind has metaphysical consequence?
Hesperus = Phosphorus?
the largest natural number is a concept but has no metaphysical existence


### Arg 3: Divisibility

the indivisibility of mind and the divisibility of body; underlying idea is still the conceivable argument

> why the mind is indivisible? 李麒麟：满足组合原则但不是整体/部分，前者是概念操作后者是空间操作


## Explanatory advantage of dualism

Descartes' argument
- I am my mind
- mind and body are different
- body is divisible and mind is not

other dualism:
- substance dualism
- property dualism
- predicate dualism: suspend metaphysical judgments, only distinct on language

What is "the mental stuff"? What is "thinking"? Is it a faculty? Is it a process? Can thinking -> mental substance?

Does physical object has to have extension?

## Pros and Cons 

- Pros:
    * The arguments are prima facie plausible
    * The crucial difference between mind and body
    * A framework for studying mind

- Cons:
    * The soundness/validity of the arguments are controversial (because the Cartesian account is only an intelletualist approach)
    * What is the nature of mind? The answer from dualists tend to compare, but not address them directly `why? isn't it just a un-reductable account?`
    * Counterarguments: How the interactions between mind and body?

# 2. Behaviorism and Its Problems 

Gilbert Ryle (1900-1976): British ordinary language philosophy (the school that analyze language to understand phenomena)
Coined "ghost in the machine", best known book: *The concept of mind*

## Ryle's critique on Descartes

### Cartesian view on introspection:

A function of the mind, introspection/"mind eye", which is very different from normal sense because it is infallible

We cannot experience other minds. We can only understand other minds **by analogy**. 

### Categorical Mistake

The example of "university tour": 

- after seeing faculties and faculties, you ask: where is the university?
- after seeing battalions and squadrons, you ask: where is the march-past? 

This is a categorical mistake: the inability to use English language to wield concept

`李麒麟：Is the analogy valid? Descartes does not know how to use words?`

Wittgenstein's example: Expectation = minding the time, starting to anxious, etc

`李麒麟：And what is categorical mistake? Blackwell: putting things to different category as if they are categorically different. It presupposes a category. Is it circular? *A book on carogory mistake*`

`what? as if they are different?`

### Mental States are **Ryle:NOT** causes of behaviors

The properties that can describe physical things CANNOT be used for mental things. Therefore they are different. 
There needs to be a cause other than physical cause.

## Behaviorism: 

### Philosophy vs. Psychological

**Methodological Behaviorism**

Psychological approach only use words to **classify** behaviors. 
Psychology only treat mental states as the reasons to explain behaviors. They are not synonyms.
It is only a methodological preference to only investigate observable behaviors.
`It does not presupposes the metaphysical assumption that mental events are reductable to behaviors? It is only a tag that does not have to have intension?`

**Logical Behaviorism**

Mental talk only a convenient abbreviation of physical talk. They are synonyms. A stronger one is Ontological Behaviorism.
*This is only a language claim*. 

**Ontological Behaviorism**

Here does not exist mental entities. 
*This is a ontological claim*

`Think: Can the logical version derive the ontological version? It does not follow that the metaphysical entity must be physical`

### What is behavior?

1. Psychological responses: blood pressure, increase of heart rate, etc
2. Bodily movement: Walk, run, etc
3. Actions constitutes movement: i.e. The difference between monkeys accidentally writes an email vs. People writing email
4. Actions without movement: judge, assume, decide, calculate, etc. (mental act)

The last two types has **structure**. Behaviorists mainly concern the first three/two types because the last one/two contains non-observable components (the structure/intentionality`telos?`). Therefore, behaviorism is a *reductive physicalism*

`The definition of behavior is controversial`

### Weakened Versions

Two ways to weaken logical behaviorism:

- They have ontological identity, but they do not have the same meaning
- They have the same meaning, but do not promise the ontological identity

I.e. Aristotle is the author of Metaphysics, and there is such metaphysical identity, but Aristotle does not have the same meaning as the author of Metaphysics. (same extension ≠ same intension)

## Problems

Hilary Putnum(1926 - 2016): Philosophy of Math, Science, Language, Mind

### Putnum's characterization of behaviorism

Mental states = the logical constructions of **actual, potential and possible** behaviors

Two these:

- there exists analytical entailment.
- not translatable only because mind talk is ambiguous

Analytical entailment: M ↔ P by virtue of the meaning itself
This **CAN** be analytical even if it depends on empirical facts

Something right about logical behaviorism: the intension of the word 'pain' is more than what I experienced.

You understand the reference of 'pain' by observing its sense, the 'behavior'

Cluster concept: compare proper name and description

Putnum: Name of diseases

Symptom is the presentation of disease, but the essence of the disease seems not to be the logical constructions of symptoms. We don't say the disease *is* the symptoms. On the contrary, we say the symptoms are caused by the disease.

How we talk about things comes **after** the thing itself, not the thing itself is a logical construction of how we talk about it.

And it is logically possible that parallelism is true.

Super-Spartans and X-worlders

The existence of pain is the perception of pain (the ontological feature of pain)

# 3. Identity theory

## More thoughts on Pain

**phantom of limb**

The pain in the phantom of limb (Nelson) is the mistake of physical(spacial) limb, not the pain.

**attention**

If someone did not pay attention to pain?

E.g. A soldier get shot when he began to charge, but he only realized it after the charging ends.

Then *when* the pain came into being? (compare pain killer)

## Basic Claim

It seems hard to say pain is *only* in the body, or *only* in the mind. It seems that we cannot say they have the same intension.

> "后天必然命题，如水是H2O"


The **extension** of mind and body are the same, but not necessarily the same **intension**. Therefore, this is not a claim about meaning. It's a metaphysical claim.

Problem: What if a creature that don't have a brain?

# 4. Functionalism

*Not on a priori ground, but to say if one hypothesis is better than identity theory*

Mental state is the functional state of the whole organism

To extend identity theory to other creatures. It is similar to token-token identity theory, but it is not token-token identity. `why?`

Any program is a tuple of (I,S,O,F,G):

- I: all possible physical input
- S: all possible mental state
- O: all possible physical output
- F: the mapping of (I,S) to S
- G: the mapping of (I,S) to O

The configuration of M = {P}xIxSxO

> What is "mental state"? Why is it a state? What is a state?

Putnum: octopus can be hungry just as human `really?`

Advantage: 
1. Across species
2. Across individuals within one species
3. Within a singular individual over time

## Problems with functionalism

Pain is a infallible self-knowledge. Even if there are some "illusion of pain", it also count as pain. (Notice the difference between pain and hunger)

If we adopt sense-reference modal, then the reference of pain **is the sense of pain**

### Comparison of intuitions:

**Dualism:** Mind is not physical. 
*Assertion:* mind is another entity

**Behaviorism:** We observe other's behaviors to learn mental words. 
*Assertion:* Mind is behavior

**Identity Theory:** We can observe the correlation between brain activity and mental states. 
*Assertion:* Mind is brain states

**Functionalism:** Other creatures can have consciousness.
No assertion. Purely abstract assertion that mind is some kind of structure/functional role. Very *scientific*.
*Problem:* Our intuition is that mind must have feels (qualia)

### Block: Homunculi-headed robots

Prima facie counterexample: functionalism Chinese system

It attacks on whether functionalism machine has any mental states at all

It seems that **raw feeling** is missing; 

`mind = functionalism + raw feeling?`

Dilemma: Multiple realizability vs. raw feels

Self-knowledge and my own mental state:

1. What pain is
2. Whether the pain occurs
3. Whether I am having a pain

### Nida: Qualia

The felt or phenomenal qualities associated with experience

*To know what it is like to have an experience* is to *know its qualia*

If qualia are something over and above the physical and functional facts, then is it knowable? Should we event try to make that theoretical? "Elimmativists"

Inverted Spectrum: they are functionally equivalent, but in scientifically different

Conceptual functionalism: intension/meaning identity
Psychofunctionalism: extension identity, ensuring the compatibility between science and philosophy

> How do we know what is a function and what is an implementation of a function? Is qualia a function or content? How do we know qualia is some spacial feature of the brain implementation of consciousness?

## 5. Turing's test

Can machine think?

What is the meaning of think?

Should we use a poll? It seems unhelpful

The gender game

> 思考题：What can we derive from the gender game? The man is obviously NOT a woman even if the man can imitate perfectly


> 思考题：Do intelligence has to come with consciousness, especially consciousness in the sense of qualia?

1. read a *symbol*
2. erase and replace a symbol
3. move left or right
4. shut down
