# Unit 1: Plato and ancient epistemology

## Beginning with Plato

1. **If cultivating x efficiently is in our interest, then it is in our interest to know x.**
2. a has no interest in knowing knowledge itself.
3. Cultivating knowledge efficiently is not in a's interest
4. Philosophers are interested in cultivating knowledge

$\therefore$ a is not a philosopher.

Three major works about knowledge: Meno, Republic, Theaetetus

### High and low views of knowledge

> Does the view of high and low conceptions of knowledge make Plato in his republic period committed to methodism?

#### The high view:

knowledge of **Forms** is the ultimate and the only possible objects of knowledge. <--> opinion: from **senses**

> 知识范围&认知主体：local and limited skepticism
> - does not deny that we can have knowledge at all
> - most "knowledge" we thought are not real knowledge
> - only philosopher can possess knowledge

knowledge is a state of an individual in virtue of which she has infallible, unerring insight into eternal truths through her intellectual grasp of the Forms

Modern refutations:
- ARG1: If you know P, then it is necessary that P 
- REF: If you know P, then it is the case that P,
or you can not know "it is raining". Your state of mind is not such as to be able to filter out error, an infallible truth-attaining state.
- REF on REF: It is possible that there is a state of mind that infallibly attain truth.

The premise of ARG1: Our essential nature is immortal and rational.

#### The low view:
P is knowledge if and only if P can be taught (Meno)  
mundane examples of expertise: medicine, wine-growing, gymnastics, music and cookery(Theaetetus 178b ff.)

2 ways to apply the concept of knowledge:
1. the state of an individual who know some theorem
2. geometry, automotive engineering...

### Inquiry and knowledge

> Two ways to do inquiry:
> 	1. Exploring the belief (the extent of the set)
> 	2. Examine the belief (the element of the set)
> Key questions:
> 	- What is knowledge? the nature of knowledge
> 	- What can we know? the extent of knowledge & how do we know what we do know?
> Guiding question: What is the nature of knowledge?
> The **object** of the inquiry/-ies: knowledge
> The **objective** of the inquiry/-ies: to reveal/discover some essential properties of knowledge (necessary condition/-s)
> 
> Types of knowledge: (not exclusive and usually entangled in reality)
> - propositional knowledge
> - ability knowledge/know how/knowing-how
> - knowledge by acquaintance
> - knowledge-to/know-to/knowing-to (黄勇 动力之知)

#### Meno’s Paradox:
A man cannot try to discover either what he knows or what he does not know. He would not seek what he knows, for since he knows it there is no need of the inquiry, nor what he does not know, for in that case he does not even know what he is to look for. (Meno 80e)

> the problem of criterion: in the conceptional sense  
> Meno's paradox: "no need": in the practical sense  
> The practical solution to Meno's paradox: the use of interrogative words  
> ==LEFT QUESTION: What did interrogative words give to us about the object we question?==

The constrain on inquiry: we do know what we want to know

Socrates, despite claiming to be ignorant about virtue, knows how to use *What* is virtue to inquire the knowledge about virtue. Therefore, Socrates uses Meno’s Paradox to distract our attention from the interrogative words, by means of which we are able to identify bits of knowledge without spelling them out.

What kind of inquiry triggers Meno's Paradox?

#### Different mode of inquiry

##### Market-place inquiry

When you seek information from another person, you cast them the role of expert. 

- constraint: the enquirer must be able to recognize an answer to her question (which is the condition of having a question in mind).

`markdet-place inquiry does not tigger Meno's paradox? Or it require one to have knowledge about the NAME of the object being inquired?`


> social trust

##### Cartesian inquiry

Does not ask another person to supply the information she wants, but looks for it on her own. 

###### scrutiny

i.e. Mixing 2 concoctions together to see what will happen. 

For philosophers, they mull over an **already available concept/thing** to determine an argument. (This is not Socrates used because he claims not to know anything about virtue at all)

> The real object/the conceptional object

###### searching

this is the type of inquiry that triggers Meno's paradox

> The criterion of identification/judgment

- There are, on a street in Bristol, some pedestal tables of bronze known as the Nails. In days gone by, merchants, transacting their business, paid their debts “on the nail”, as we still say. The Nails are now a well-known tourist attraction, and we can easily imagine a tourist looking for them. Any guidebook will tell her about them. But imagine a tourist without a guidebook who has simply no idea at all what the Bristol Nails are. How could such a person possibly look for them? Even if she ran up against them, how could she know that they were what she was looking for?

- constraint: You cannot search for X, whatever X maybe, unless you are from the outset equipped with a good enough notion of what X is to provide you with criteria by which to **judge whether you have found what you were looking for**.  
  
> Meno's paradox challenges both inquiry that they need sufficient understanding to recognize conclusions to the inquiry. We cannot be completely ignorant.  
> Plato's version of solving this problem: the doctrine of recollection

It is not so different between the two kinds of inquiry above. Both inquirers need to be able to recognize what is a possible answer.

`Does interrogative words give the criterion of possible answers?`


#### Another feature about knowing

"know" is differentiated from "believe", "think" or "hold" because they will not tolerate interrogative constructions after it.  


### Meno's challenge  
  
> Meno's problem/challenge: the value of knowledge  
> Meno's paradox/puzzle: how to investigate knowledge  
>    
> The primary value problem: Why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief?  
> The secondary value problem: Why knowledge is more valuable, from an epistemic point of view, than any proper subset of its parts?  
> The tertiary value problem: Why knowledge is qualitatively better than any epistemic standing falling short of knowledge? (see SEP: "The value of knowledge")
> 
> Intrinsic/instrumental value of knowledge

What is the difference between knowledge and correct opinion, and why knowledge should be prized more highly than correct opinion?

#### Meno's perspective

1. We can only fit our actions to our wishes in the light of our representations of how things are.
2. If we want to achieve our goals, We want and value states of mind that accurately represent how things are.
3. A correct opinion is a correct representation of how things actually are

--- 

∴ A correct opinion is sufficient for practical purposes.

#### Possible responses

##### Generic difference response

1. Knowing is a state if a person which is of a totally **different kind** from believing or opining. Knowledge is intrinsically more valuable because it is truth attaining and most important.
Problem: in mundane matters like getting from Athens to Larissa.

2. There is no difference in kind between the sorts of things one can know about and the sort of things about which one has beliefs. What matters is the **commitments and the implications** of these different styles of representations (what's the difference between this and differentiating component response?)

First-hand experience as knowledge?

Reads more into the text than it supports.

REF: Recollection of the route to Larissa is less reliable than a map.(?)

##### differentiating component response

> The classical JTB S knows that p, **iff: (Welbourne's term: if, which avoided Gettier's problem)**
> 	1. S believes that p
> 	2. p is true, and
> 	3. S is justified in believing that p  **(S is justified, not S's belief, which is Welbourne's term)**
> 
> Component 1: "S believes that p"
>
> 	- Is believing really necessary: knowledge-first approach
> 
> Component 2: "S's belief that p is true"
>
> 	- Commonsensical concept of truth:
> 		- to assume that truth is **objective**(?)
> 	- facitivity: "If S knows that p, then is true"
> 		- To elaborate: If S knows that p, then p cannot be false:
> 			- The modal-term scope ambiguity:
> 				- ~~If S knows that p, then it is necessary that p. $(Ksp \supset \square p)$~~ 
> 				- It is necessary that if S knows p, then p. $\square (Ksp \subset p)$ 
> $A \subset B$
> Component 3 and Meno's challenge:
>
> 	- Meno's challenge: the difference and value between knowledge and true belief
> 	- knowing vs. merely "getting it right" (Prichard 2018, pp. 5-7)
> 	- the tether 

Conceding that knowing entails believing.  
someone knows that P = someone believes that P + **differentiating component**(e.g. It is correct in doing so)  
This is Plato's immediate response in Meno

tripartite analyses
1. You believe that P.
2. P is true.
3. Your belief that P has some specially valuable status-conferring feature like being justified or obtained by a reliable method or whatever – something, at least, that excludes or at the very least minimizes the chances of its being wrong.

there can be quite radical difference in the way the differentiating component is conceived or the third clause is completed.

###### Locke: individual's understanding

So much as we ourselves consider and comprehend of truth and reason, so much we possess of real and true knowledge. The floating of other men’s opinions in our brains makes us not one jot the more knowing, though they happen to be true (1975: 1, 4, 23)

###### Modern: justification  
  
If A is justified in holding it, then A's belief amounts to knowledge.  
i.e. The justification for believing something, like Pythagoras' theorem, could just come from a reliable textbook without being able to follow the proof.  
Problem: Gettier 1963

###### Modern: externalist and internalist

Externalist: A knows that P when her true belief that P is **properly connected to the state of affairs** she believes to obtain

`External evidence vs. The state of being sure about the external evidence?`

Internalist: Theories that require that the believer be justified in holding what she does, that she should have weighed the evidence adequately and so on

## Analyzing knowledge Plato's way

### The Meno account
 
we do know the answers already, having learned in some previous mode of existence.

knowledge = unstable true belief + "the tether"(aitias logismos, working out with reason) fastening the true belief

Problems:

1. How aitias logismos tether a belief?

We can sap one's confidence by reminding he was always convinced by bogus proof though he did proved correctly this time.

2. Why is stability is a source of intrinsic value?

Trivial things like what time the film I was going to see was on should not be "tethered" permanently. By contrast, the inability to forget things can be a serious *disability*.

3. What does it mean by "tethering"?

### The Theaetetus account

> Castagnoli, Luca (2004 "Protagora Retufed"; 2010 Ancient Self-refutation)

#### knowledge equates perception

> 李麒麟: This definition comes into the dialogue because of the importance of perception? (compare Republic: you cannot get any knowledge from perception)

##### REF1: Elimination of experts

1. If knowledge equates perception, then there is no objective truth of the matter.
2. If there is no objective truth of the matter, then no one is more knowledgeable than anyone else.
3. Experts on a certain field is more knowledgeable than other people.

∴ It is false that knowledge equates perception

##### REF2: Self-defeating of relativism

Relativism is self-defeating because it is justified for one to think it is wrong.

> But this refutations, on the meta-meta level, confirms relativism.

##### REF3: Transcendence of knowledge

Perceptual properties transcend what is actually given in perception.  
  
> multi-perception knowledge referring one object  
> epistemic perception vs. raw perception
> judgment about the content

> A knowledge cannot be reduced to a single perception

###### Modern explanation:

- A baby smells escaping gas. But it does not *judge* that there is an escape of gas. 
- A cat *sees that* a bird is in the garden, but it does not see that a bird *is* in the garden.

`That is to say, they does not *consciously* process the content`

###### Plato's explanation:

There is no objective way to judge perception (in *Republic*). (because of the Heraclitus' flux theory)  
Thus, he would deny the very possibility of so-called epistemic seeing.

A connected difficulty: How is possible to have a false belief, that is, I believe that ~P?

#### true judgment or true belief

Problem:

1. Rhetorical persuasion cannot impart knowledge but only belief, and it can be true. Therefore there is a distinction between knowledge and true belief. `By means of how you learn it? Rehtoric does not give the right structure of knowledge (does not provide the chain of cause)? The definition of rehtoric seems unclear, though.`

#### true judgment with logos  
  
Tripartite analyses of knowledge: knowledge = true belief + logos  
Problem: What is logos?  
  
> The insufficiency of merely spelling words & 
> *just* specifying all the element, &
> *just* specifying distinctive mark

##### spell out one's belief (206d1–e4)

Problem: Too general

##### specify all elements (207a1–208b12)

REF: Not enough; You won't know how to spell a word even if you know all the letters needed. It must be in a right order.

##### specify distinctive mark (208c–210a10)

REF: If I have no idea at all how Theaetetus differs from other individuals, how could I even have a (true) belief about him

# Unit 2: Gettier's Problem

> the content:
> - Introduction of the examples of the traditional definition
> - 2 presuppositions
> - 2 counterexamples

## Current models

### JTB:
S knows that P ⟺
1. P is true
2. S believes that P, and
3. S is justified in believing that P

### Chisholm's version
S knows that P ⟺
1. P is true
2. S accepts P, and
3. S has adequate evidence for P

### Ayer's version
S knows that P ⟺
1. P is true
2. S is sure that P is true, and
3. S has the right to be sure that P is true

## Refutation:
The conditions stated therein does not constitute a sufficient condition for the truth of the proposition that S knows that P in following cases:

### Two Presuppositions

#### Presupposition I

It is possible for a person to be **justified** in believing a proposition that is in fact **false**.

> Or T in JTB  will be unnecessary. 

#### Presupposition II

If S is justified in believing P and P entails Q **and S deducted Q from P and accepts Q as a result of this deduction**,    
then S is justified in believing Q

> the bold part may not be sufficient, i.e. reductio ad absurdium.

> Antecedent strengthened version vs. consequent weakened version:  
>  
> *Antecedent strengthened version*: Gettier's version, with the bold part strengthening the antecedent
> *Consequent weakened version*: removing the bold part; the consequent changed into "being in the position to be justified in believing/being in a position to know/… that Q"


### Two Cases

> Gettier's counterexamples are aimed at criticizing JTB → knowledge, but said nothing about knowledge → JTB  
  
#### Case A  
  
Smith and Jones have applied for a certain job and Smith has strong evidence that Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten coins in his pocket.  
Meanwhile, Smith does not know he will get the job and he also has 10 coins in his pocket.  
Therefore for proposition (e):

(e) The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket

1. e is true
2. S believe e is true
3. S is justified in believing that e is true.

However Smith does not know that he has 10 coins in his pocket, which means he does not know (e).

>what is the symbolic logic form of (g) and (e)? Can we deduct (e) from (g)? The re-interpretation and the evaluation  
  
#### Case B  
  
Smith has strong evidence that Jones owns a Ford because Jones told him so and offered him a ride. Smith has another friend brown of whose whereabouts he is totally ignorant.    
Meanwhile, Jones in fact rented the Ford and boasted in front of Smith. In addition by the sheerest coincidence, Brown happen to live in Boston. Therefore for proposition:  
(g) Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Boston

1. g is true
2. S believe g is true
3. S is justified in believing that g is true.
However Smith does not know g because he does not know either component of g.

> 1. disjunction introduction: p -> pvq
> 2. Why he does not know g? what is the mental state that knows a disjunction form?  
  
## Gettier cases (Not Gettier's case)


> Critical evaluation of Gettier's cases
> What is the common factor in Case A and B?    
> 	- Doxastic inference  
> 	- A false justified belief occurs as a premise in the inference  
>    
> Gettier's cases -> Gettier cases:
> Is the doxastic inference or false justified belief occurs as a premise indispensable?  
  
  
  
### Group 1: helpful Gettier case  
  
The sheep on the hill(Chisholm 1966)  
You see a rock on a hill. The rock looks exactly like a sheep from your viewpoint. You think "that's a sheep, so there's a sheep on the hill". As it turns out, there are sheep on the hill, but they are out of view behind some trees past the rock. You have justified a true belief that there are sheep on the hill, but do you know there are sheep on the hill.  
  
Havit/Nogot (Lehrer 1965)  
You see Nogot driving a Ford on a regular basis. Nogot tells you he owns the Ford. You've never seen Havit drive at all; Havit walk everywhere or take public transportation. There are three people who work in the office: you., Nogot, and Havit. You don't own a ford.  Your reason like this Nogot owns a Ford, and Nogot works in a office, and so someone who works in the office owns a Ford. It turns out Nogot doesn't own the Ford he has been driving at all. Moreover, Havit does own a Ford, but it's an old classic car he never drives. You have a justified true belief that someone in the office owns a Ford, but do yo u know that someone in the office owns a Ford?  
  
### Group 2: dangerous Gettier case  
  
Barn Facade Country(1976)
The case of assassination(Harman 1968, p.172)

Dangerous epistemic environment

### The nature of Gettier's case

- epistemic luck and anti-luck epistemology
- Pritchard: not epistemic luck, but epistemic risk
- Zagzebski: If it's TB + X, then:
    * If X entails TB, then skepticism will arise
    * If X does not entail TB, then you can construct XFB and the use good luck to make it XTB

The more technical JTB is, the less intuitive such that the value of knowledge becomes hard to understand. You need to give an account for both "what is knowledge" and "what is the value of knowledge"

# Unit 3: Defining knowledge

## The problem of criterion

 How to define knowledge?    
  
### Criterion  
 gathering **lots of instants of knowledge** and work out what all these cases have in common.    
 	problem: this method presupposed distinguished marks or criteria of knowledge. If don't know such criteria, how am I suppose to identify cases in the first place?  
 	--> accordingly, one might think that the right thing to do first is to first **identify what the criteria for knowledge** are and then use the knowledge to identify instances of knowledge  
 		problem: unless I am able to identify instances of knowledge, then it's not clear how I would go about determining what the criteria for knowledge are.  
 therefore, one must either groundlessly assume that one can identify cases of knowledge, or groundlessly assume that one knows what the criteria for knowledge are. Neither option seems particularly appealing (Pritchard 2018, p. 231)

### Methodism
coined by Richard Chisholm(1916-99) to describe one historically popular way responding to **the problem of the criterion**, claiming that we can through **philosophical reflection** determine what the criteria of knowledge are **without** needing to refer to any particular instances of knowledge(Pritchard 2018, p. 231) i.e. Descartes

### Particularism 
claiming that we can **identify instances** of knowledge **without first having a grasp** of what the criteria for knowledge are.

 ## Responding to the Gettier cases

### Solutions:

#### Justificationist account:

##### The no-false-assumption account

If there is any false assumption in justification, then you do not know P.

Problem: how to tell if an assumption is relevant to the belief P

> 思考题：what is the difference between no-defeater and no-false-assumption account? 思考理论的差异

##### No-defeater account

A *defeater*: if there is a fact that, if *discovered by the subject* then would give them good reason to revise their beliefs, then it is a defeater

Defeasibility account: to know P is to have JTB of P where there is no defeater of such belief

Counterexample: You saw Tom stole a book. The defeater is that, Tom's mother lies in the court about Tom having a twin brother Tim, though you are not there. But do you know Tom stole a book?

Diagnosis: there may be misleading defeaters

> Won't the rough version lead to infallibilism?


#### Reliability account:

##### The causal account

To know that P is that P is causally connected to P

Counterexample: The fake barn case

##### sensitivity account

make no mistake

**Rough account:** If P were false, then s would `more likely to` not believe that P

Diagnosis: This account did not take any account of **in what way** do s knows that P. Therefore there will be counterexamples that Grandma knows that his grandson is healthy by looking at him, and she may be deceived by her kids that her grandson is healthy while her grandson is sick. In this example, if we apply the sensitivity account, then grandma DOES NOT know her grandson is healthy by looking at him.

**Upgraded account:** If s believes that P using method M, then if P were false, s would not believe P using method M.


Problem: failure of closure principle because S knows that P→Q does not entail P◻→Q

##### safety account

If you believed P, then `it is more likely that` P would be true

> compare: modal fragility and actual fragility
> barn's case vs. 将断未断的保险丝

Counterexamples: sometimes some fragile belief still count as knowledge. e.g. 将断未断的保险丝

> 思考题：停走钟表案例是否符合安全性和敏感性

#### Relevant Alternatives  
  
"an alternative to P": Merely logical; defined by 'compatibility'  
  
"an *relevant* alternative to P": 
One way to delineate: to use modal concept: Had P been false, alternative A might appear

"rule out": 
- avoid "knowing that it is false" because it would lead to circularity
- The evidence is sensitive to the context: e.g. I see something on the table; the evidence no longer can rule our RAs when we meet a skeptical context.


#### Competence Account

To know is to have a TB and it is true because you exercised your intellectual competence

To compare: Sosa's virtue epistemology vs Zagzebski's account

Counterexample: fake barn case, again

### Dissolutions: 
 
#### irreducible knowledge-first epistemology

Timothy Williamson: Knowledge and its limits

E = K

Evidence are propositions, and knowledge are the best state of propositions

#### understanding, not knowledge

Edward Craig: use P appropriately in reasoning; to mark good sources; get the truth to our own competence

### Direct response

False presuppositions
problem:    
1. What is the false presupposition?  
2. Do the agent need to presuppose anything at all?  
(?)  
  
External demands  
The traditional account: the true condition relates to the world and the other two condition that could be obtained regardless of the world.


### Counterfactual tool

Ksp∧⋄¬P: s knows that P and *s knows that at least one possible world in which not P* --> epistemic strength

刻画认知的稳定性/强度/力度，区分偶然为真

If it were the case that p, then it would be the case that q

The standard procedure of P◻→Q

- fix the actual world
- To choose at least one *closest* possible worlds where P is the case
- To evaluate if Q still occurs

- Semantics of P→Q: It is not the case that P and not Q
- Semantics of ◻P→Q: In all possible worlds, 

A possible world is **complete** and **possible(non-contradicting)**

An informal definition of epistemic strength: The distance `what is the distance of possible worlds?` between the actual world and the farthest possible world that we are able to evaluate.


We introduce "the distance of possible worlds" to describe what does "happen to be true" mean


#### Examples:

Now a sugar cube is presented to you.

Counterfactual condition:
- If it were put into water, this sugar cube would be dissolved: TRUE (In a possible world that is close to the actual world except the sugar cube is put into water, it is true that the sugar cube is dissolved)
- If it were put into water, this sugar cube would *not* be dissolved: FALSE (In a possible world that is close to the actual world except the sugar cube is put into water, it is false that the sugar cube is dissolved)  
  
That is, the truth value is dependent on the which possible world, constrained by the consequent, is closer

Problem:
The distance between possible worlds and the actual world:
- The phenomenal/static similarity
- The nomological/nomic similarity

Normal condition:
- If it is put into water (F), this sugar cube is dissolved: TRUE
- If it is put into water (F), this sugar cube is *not* dissolved: TRUE
