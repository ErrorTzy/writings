# Part I: What is contextualism?

## A paradoxical example

**Bank case A:**
Friday: To deposit an unimportant paycheck
My wife: Maybe it won't open tomorrow
Me: I was there two weeks ago, I know it will open

**Bank case B:**
Friday: To deposit an important paycheck that will bounce next Monday
My wife: Maybe it won't open tomorrow because bank may change their hours. 
Me: (I was there two weeks ago) I will go and make sure. I don't know it will open.

Assume that the bank will be open on Saturday:

(1) When I am in case A and I say know, it is true.
(2) When I am in case B and I say I don't know, it is false.
(3) If when I am in case A and I know, then when I am in case B I also know
(4) If when I am in case A and say I know, it is true; then when I am in case B and say I don't know, it is false.

It is obvious that 1, 2, 4 are inconsistent. But is 1, 2, 3 consistent?

## Answer from contextualism

The contextualists can deny (4) while admitting (3) because the truth conditions of the sentences of the form "S knows that p" or "S does not know that p" vary by context.

Contextual difference between case A and case B:

1. the importance of being right: It is important for me to be right in case B.
2. the mentioning of possibility: My wife mentioned the possibility in case B. 
3. the consideration of possibility: I considered the possibility in case B. (DeRose *personally* thinks this is not a valid factor)

## Answer from invariantism

The invariantists deny the contextual factors and asserts (4). The invariantists includes:

1. Skeptical invariantism: Deny (1). I don't know in both A and B. It is only useful for me to say that "I know" in case A, but it is false.
2. Non-skeptical invariantism: Deny (2). I know in both A and B, but it would be misleading for me to say "I know" to my wife because she thought knowing should exclude the possibility of changing the hour. However it is not a necessary condition for knowing.

## Why it is better than skepticism

Skepticism: we never achieve knowledge even in the mundane level.

Response: skepticism *raises the standards* for knowledge in their skeptical arguments. But we can still claim that we know in *relaxed context*. Therefore, the skepticism is persuasive but meanwhile our ordinary claims are safeguarded.

The problem for *both* skeptical invariantism and contextualism is that they both need to bite the bullet.

The bullet for invariantism: we never achieve knowledge
The bullet for contextualism: we need to deny 4 but admit 3

> What about the non-skeptical invariantism?

# Part II: Difference between contextualism and relevant alternatives

## Relevant Alternative (RA) theory: 

S know that p, iff. S is able to distinguish p from these relevant alternatives, and able to rule out these relevant alternatives to p. 

### What makes an alternative a relevant alternative?

#### Subject factors

If there are a lot of such facades in the knowers' vicinity, then the possibility that the person is seeing a facade is a relevant alternative.

Putative *subject* in evaluating the claim

> How exactly does the circumstance affect the requirement of knowledge? The external truth condition?

#### Attributor factors

The speaker's own linguistic and psychological context. Eg. If the speaker has just read about Descartes' devil, then the possibility that a devil is deceiving him is a relevant alternative.

*Attributor* of knowledge

> How a person understands "know"? The internal truth condition?

Invariantist can be a RA theorist if he only accepts subject factors. In this case, he can reject (3), and admit (1) and (2).

> This version of invariantist seems to mean that the truth condition of p may be variable, but it should indiscriminately applies to anyone at a given time.

### The importance of such distinction

There is such distinction because:

1. If there have been a zebra shortage and many zoos have been painting mules, it does not change the meaning of 'know'
2. 'Frank is in the room' and 'Frank is not in the room' does not contradict. This is because they have the same *character* but different *content*.

Attributive  factors **set a standard** which the putative subject must live up to so that the attribution can be true. Therefore, this determines the content/meaning of attribution. 

> Therefore, the content for someone saying that *I know* is that *I* am able to exclude a set of RA selected by the standard of *mine*, according to the psychological/linguistic context.
>
> The meaning of 'know' is 'being able to rule out that', and 'that' is an indexical 
> Attributive factor determines what that indexes to.
> The subject factors determines 'Is one able to rule out the objective RAs?'
>
> Therefore, there are two sets of RAs

Subject factors decides **if the standard is met** by the putative subject. Therefore, it determines the truth value of the attribution 

The difference between contextualism and RA theory:

**RA theory**: the change in meaning is caused by the change of the range of relevant alternatives
**Contextualism**: the change in meaning is caused by the attributive factors.

# Part III: The Objections to Contextualism

## Palle's objection

It cannot be the case that you first know something, and then when someone else says something, you no longer knows.

## Response: It can be the case!

Know is an indexical. We cannot say 'I did know then, but I don't know now' because I can no longer attribute knowledge to previous me. But it is correct to say 'my previous knowledge claim is true'. Just like I can't say 'I was here' after I changed my location, but I can say 'My previous claim on location is true'.

> Is this claim valid? Why the indexical that refers to another indexical keeps the original context?

"know" is an indexical word. When I am in a yellow room and said "this room is yellow", and then entered a blue room and says "this room is blue", my former claim does not contradicts the latter. 

Therefore, according to contextualism, *in any context* (3) is true, but (4) is not. The advantage of contextualism is that, it can affirm both (1),(2),(3). It is not counterintuitive.
