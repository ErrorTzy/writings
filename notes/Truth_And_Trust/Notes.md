 Introduction

trust evidence vs. trust friend's word
- Can one really psychologically trust over
- Is it rational to trust
- How does risk comes into the decisions

The more evidence the less trust you have on your friend?

# Trust And Antitrust

What is trust

Trust vs reliance/count on it: trust is counting on someone based on the belief that he has good will

difference is that there is some kind of personal engagement? Surrendering control? Accepted vulnerability 

trust at will:

We can try to (deliberate) on trust but the consequence is somehow out of our control

Trust text
1. Why do we need a moral test for trust:
    a. The thriving of the good & bad
    b. Dilemma of the dynamic between trust and evidence
    c. Unequal relationship
2. What is the text and how does it work
3. What problems/limitations might be there

generalized from an instance -- counterexample to trust?

# Trust and Rationality

Central claim: the central conception of rationality *cannot* give an account of trust

We believe P = It is likely that P is true = We cannot have inconsistency/contradictory belief

Wanting, on the other hand, can have logically contradictory wishes, e.g. wanting to monogamously married to 4 people at once

it is possible(psychologically`???????`) but irrational to believe P and ¬P because it would be a failure to represent the world.

> Is belief rational already?

Baker's puzzle: 

(1) We would not believe P if is not likely that P is true
(2) We may believe P even if there are adequate evidence to show it is not likely that P

Skeptical Options (trust is not rational):
(1) A rational person shouldn't have irrational belief
(2) S has belief P or not is according to how skeptical the context is

Baker's proposal: we need to have another understanding of rationality
Holton: Trust is not believing at all

> The conception of rationality, even purely theoretical, as long as it includes evidence, includes some ethical conception

# Deciding to Trust, Coming to Believe

Strawson, "reactive attitudes": 
relational attitudes: angry with/gratitude/...
we react to other people's motivation
quality of will
objective stance(treating nth as objects, detached) vs. *participant stance*

Can rope hold my weight? Rely without believing; it would be irrational but possible/probable

Relying on a person as a person, to be motivated in ways we want for them to be motivated

Reliance from the participant stance: feeling disappointed/gratitude

> the nice part of this "participant stance" seems that it gives an account for betrayal
>
> But "you have no choice but to trust" count a trust?

> What is trustworthiness, exactly?

# The reasons of trust

You cannot believe P because believing P is good.
You cannot intend to do ϕ because intending to do ϕ is good. The reason must be that ϕ is good.
Similarly, trusting P because believing trusting P is good cannot be a reason. You must believe in trustworthiness.

# Getting Told and Being Believed

An evidence is a causal trace; A word is not a casual trace. You need take **responsibility** when someone heard your words.

Sometimes we are not "telling" others. The authority sometimes is sometimes in the language itself;
While sometimes the authority is from the speaker; and by doing so the speaker takes some responsibility for the truth;
Also, the audience need to decide the speaker should be a source of authority

The ability to testify --> if the ability can be hindered by injustice


Analogous to Thomas Nagel

What is a good account of distinction? how do we reason? i.e. Don't contradict oneself


# Testimonial Injustice

Justice is tied to social structure; Rawls: justice is the first virtue of social institutions

Distribution of NOT ONLY goods, but also status and rank/power

Criticism: this narrows the scope of "(in)justice". For example, *lack of respect* problem, not distribution problem `bias?`

Yet another problem: epistemic (in)justice, someone is wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower `reasonale knower?`

## What is epistemic wrong?

Wrong is not equal to harm. E.g. I sell lemonade after you sell lemonade which harms your business

You can wrong someone without intending to wrong them. E.g. I mistake you with your twin brother and do bad things to you

"tracker prejudice:" track people to social identity 

## Perceptions of trustworthiness

Identity prejudicial credibility deficit: via stereotype

Stereotype is not good/bad, and is necessary. They play the role of a heuristic.

Social generalization about trustworthiness is inevitable (and *desirable* `because it actually help establish trust`)

Therefore, *reasonable* prejudicial stereotype makes people bad *from epistemic perspective*. Therefore they are *epistemically bad*

Ethically bad, on the other hand, is when you have a noxious intention.

## Prejudicial Stereotype

Credibility judgment: almost perceptual `controvertial, perception may still have some belief involved. But at least in the weaker sense, the belief involvment is not conscious`, perceptual in the sense that we form the belief almost subconsciously, without weighting belief in between

Doxastically mediated: Personal belief is not mediating the form of judgment

> in order to avoid injustice, I am willing to go through individual by individual and waste my time on sharks

Harms:
1. Insult or degradation of a giver of knowledge
2. Lose confidence in knowledge
3. Losing intellectual courage, not to abandon one's belief
4. Important role in self-formation, steadying the mind. `we stablize our mind by engaging socially with others, or our mind will be a stew ????`

# On a supposed right to lie from philanthropy

How do we define lies?

- Not necessarily say something false
- Not necessarily intend to deceive (I believe you don't will not take it; I lie in order to show power, for example)

Kant: Lying is dishonest speech; It fails humanity

The wrong of lie is in deception or something else?


Analogy between universal laws and traffic laws `But this is not how Kant formulate his rules?`

# Two Arguments Against Lying

Korsgard: Moral philosophy must take a bigger picture, which includes human society

Kant vs. Sidgwick Paternalistic and Benevolent Lying

Sidgwick: You should lie a lot, as long as we have good reason
Kant: Never lie

Why do the two guys have such different view about it? How can we understand the disagreement?

Sidgwick:
1. According to commonsense, lying seems not good
2. If we really think about it, some exceptions seems acceptable
3. Therefore, commonsense needs to be cleaned up; But how?
4. The principle of utility can be the only valid moral principle, or it would be arbitrary
5. If it turns out that a lot of lies may be permissible, then just be it! Even if our commonsense goes on holiday!

Kant:
1. what system of rules there are to regulate us?
2. loop hole: we can lie to those that do not enter the system, i.e. children, the old, etc. that are not free an rational

# Lies and the Murderer Next Door

## How is lying defined?

Deception is not a part of the definition

The definition is not intend to answer the question "what do people ordinary mean by lying"

## What makes lying distinctively wrong?

We have the obligation to truth because we have the obligation to respect each other and figuring out what's on other's mind;

Telling lies will hinder this reliable approach.

Suspended context:

A context that the speakers are not expected to represent the content of their own mind

In a murderer case, the murderer (unlike Constant claiming that the murderer have no right) altered the context such that the problem of lying does not arise, just like the improvisation class

## Do you really have to tell the truth to the murderer

White flag is important in war, but if you abuse it to lead your enemies out of the trench

> What if I'm dying, I've been telling truth all the time, and I lied in the end to, e.g. revenge?
> And what about actors? They are always in such suspended context

A limit on art: can art go too far?

# Kantian Rigorism Mitigating Circumstances

Letter vs. spirit: obeying something written may violate the spirit

E.g. A law that want to help children may end up harm children

Paternalistic lie vs. White lie: white lie can be done to someone with full autonomy while you don't want to hurt their feelings

# Hume Of the obligation of promises

Aristotle's future contingent seems to be problematic when you promise something in the future; It becomes a necessary thing that there is an obligation.

Does Nietzsche believe in truth?

1. Is there truth at all?

All thinkings are perspectival. All representation are saturated with interest. How would it be for the look from nowhere?

2. Is truth valuable?

"Will to truth" is an admirable trait or not? It is connected to ascetism, but Nietzsche doesn't like it because it is self-hatred. But Nietzsche is proud of himself having the will of truth.

Distinguish: Truth and affirmation

Say yes to your life, including the painful, ugly and terrible parts

But how to redeem these bad parts?

The test: eternal recurrence; you should be thrilled to repeat your live

Yeah but how should I do that? Art illusion. "Tell(reconstruct) a story"
