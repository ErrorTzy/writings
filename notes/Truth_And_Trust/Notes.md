# Introduction

trust evidence vs. trust friend's word
- Can one really psychologically trust over
- Is it rational to trust
- How does risk comes into the decisions

invited to trust
vulnerability to trusting and being betrayed

justice or prejudice involved in trust

politicians need to tell truth?

# Trust And Antitrust

What is trust

Trust vs reliance/count on it: trust is counting on someone based on the belief that he has good will

difference is that there is some kind of personal engagement? Surrendering control? Accepted vulnerability 

trust at will:

We can try to (deliberate) on trust but the consequence is somehow out of our control

Trust text
1. Why do we need a moral test for trust:
    a. The thriving of the good & bad
    b. Dilemma of the dynamic between trust and evidence
    c. Unequal relationship
2. What is the text and how does it work
3. What problems/limitations might be there

generalized from an instance -- counterexample to trust?

# Trust and Rationality

Central claim: the central conception of rationality *cannot* give an account of trust

We believe P = It is likely that P is true = We cannot have inconsistency/contradictory belief

Wanting, on the other hand, can have logically contradictory wishes, e.g. wanting to monogamously married to 4 people at once

it is possible(psychologically`???????`) but irrational to believe P and Â¬P because it would be a failure to represent the world.

> Is belief rational already?

Baker's puzzle: 

(1) We would not believe P if is not likely that P is true
(2) We may believe P even if there are adequate evidence to show it is not likely that P

Skeptical Options:
(1) A rational person shouldn't have irrational belief
(2) S has belief P or not is according to how skeptical the context is

**Why Baker doesn't want to say this?**
