## Reconstruction

**Conclusion:** 

If x is rational, then x do not come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words

**Lemma A:** 

x is not rational, or x do not come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words

**Proof of A:**

1. *Assume*: x is rational and come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words
2. If x trust y with y's words, then x believe y's words. \[argued in p. 219\]
3. If x come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words, then x believe y's words, and x believe y's words due to the importance or usefulness of trust. \[p. 220, intuitive\]
4. The importance or usefulness of trust is unconnected to the truth \[hidden premise, intuitive\]
5. If x come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words, then x come to believe y's words based on a process that is unconnected to the truth. \[from 2, 3\]
6. If x is rational and x come to believe P based on a process that is unconnected to the truth, then x lose x's belief P. \[p. 221, intuitive\]
7. If x lose x's belief P, then it is not the case that x believe P \[trivially true\]
8. x believe y's words \[from 1, 3\]
9. It is not the case that x believe P \[from 1, 5, 6, 7\]
10. *Therefore*, x is not rational, or x do not come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words \[8 and 9 contradicts\]

**Proof of Conclusion:**

1. *Assume*: x is rational, and x come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words
2. x do not come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words \[from Lemma A, 1\]
3. x come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words \[from 1\]
4. *Therefore,* If x is rational, then x do not come to believe y's words by deciding to trust y with y's words \[2 and 3 contradicts\]

## Evaluation

In the proof of A, premise (6) seems to use the word "rational" a bit too arbitrary. For example, Kant claimed that he believes in free will, the God and immortality of the soul, and he claimed he does it rationally. But surely the way he believe them is not connected to any facts. Maybe Kantian ethics is a bit irrational and crazy after all, but anyway invoking such a big word here is simply not rigorous enough.

Then what does 'rational' here actually mean? It seems to describe someone who will only believe propositions that are well-grounded such that these proposition is most likely to represent how the world is. 

If we fix it this way, it seems there will be something for Hieronymi to explain further. This is because this account of rationality only covers a limited amount of propositions. What if your friend says "Abortion is not good"? There seems no fact that can correspond with such statement. In this case, would there be a rational trust? Or there cannot be trust on these kind of propositions?
