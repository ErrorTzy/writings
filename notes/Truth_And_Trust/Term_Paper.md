## Intro

In this paper, I first introduce the dilemma of trust: we are torn between two competing motives. On the one hand, we want to deliberate carefully to minimize the risk of betrayal or harm. On the other hand, we yearn for trust to be effortless and natural. I argue that this tension is present in all forms of trust. Then, I point out that much of the philosophical literature focuses narrowly on the first motivation, emphasizing rationality and justification. This approach overlooks an essential aspect of trust: its emotional core and its connection to our longing for harmony and connection. To resolve this dilemma, I argue that we must step outside the purely rational framework. I close the paper by suggesting that while we do have a responsibility to reflect on trust, there are times when deliberation alone cannot guide us. In cases of justified indeterminacy, we should embrace our vulnerability and allow our hearts to make the final decision.

## The Central Dilemma

In Eden, trust was unnecessary. We lived in perfect harmony, never questioning whether anything might harm us. Everything existed exactly as it should.

Then we tasted the fruit of deception. We discovered that harmony was an illusion - people could speak truth with their lips while lying in their hearts. And we tasted the fruit of fallibility, realizing our unexamined choices could lead to devastating consequences, hurting both ourselves and those we cherish. So our fell from Eden. We start to have the problem of who should we trust, and when. 

Consider how an infant enters the world in a state of pure, unquestioning trust with their parents. In this state of innocence, they naturally extend this absolute trust to all faces they encounter, believing the world operates on the same principles of unconditional love and care they experience from their mother. But then comes their first encounter with deception. This moment marks their own personal fall from Eden. The realization dawns, however unconsciously, that not all smiles carry warmth, not all gentle words speak truth, and not all who appear kind harbor good intentions.

When we want to say something about trust, we must deal with a dilemma. On the one hand, we want to make careful reflection in order not to be prone to error. Yet we're simultaneously drawn toward a return to Eden. We want trust to be non-reflective. This may be a longing that runs deep in our souls. We yearn to dissolve the barriers between self and other, to be loved, trusted, and cared for, because at our core, we are beings who feel incomplete and alone. As Aristophanes suggested, we are like beings split in half, eternally searching for our other part. Trust becomes the bridge that can reconnect us, helping us recover some fragment of that lost wholeness.

## Trust and Reliance

Some might argue that this account offers only a partial view of trust. After all, trust takes many forms. We trust intimates, strangers, and even our enemies in certain situations. My account focuses solely on trust between intimates. To use Baier's example, we trust our enemies when we lay down our weapons and raise a white flag. However, such trust is not rooted in intimacy or the longing for wholeness. We do not see our enemies as our "lost other half."

In order to answer this doubt, I wish to draw the distinction between trust and mere reliance. According to Baier, trust involves reliance on another's goodwill, whereas mere reliance does not. To use Baier's example, consider a shopkeeper running a grocery store. Suppose rumors spread that the shopkeeper is poisoning the food. In response, the local police station several security guards at the store to prevent any wrongdoing. As a customer, you might feel safe purchasing groceries, but this sense of safety depends on the presence of the guards, not on the shopkeeper’s goodwill. In this case, Baier would argue, you do not trust the shopkeeper; you merely rely on external measures to ensure safety. Trust, by contrast, emerges in a different scenario. If you are a friend of the shopkeeper and know him to be a kind, ethical person who started the store to serve the community, you would trust him not to poison the food. This trust is grounded in your belief in his character and goodwill, not external deterrents.

Baier’s definition of trust is not without its critics. Some argue that the reliance on goodwill is neither necessary nor sufficient for trust. Let us set it aside for now. Instead, I wish to draw attention to another question: why do we *need to* distinguish this special kind of reliance at all? What makes trust stand out as more significant than other forms of reliance?

When it comes to planning and decision-making, the distinction between trust and reliance may seem minimal. According to Holton, trust appears to be merely adverbial. You can buy groceries trustingly, but this attitude doesn’t seem to influence the basic decision to purchase groceries. I am not saying that trust makes no difference in behavior. If you are a logical behaviorist, there may still be ways to detect trust. For instance, if someone buys groceries trustingly, they might buy more than they would if acting out of mere reliance. On the other hand, if the shopkeeper is your friend, and you do not purchase groceries with trust. Then he might feel hurt, saying you no longer trust him. However these behavioral differences are all grounded on the mental state of trust. We praise this special mental state, and we sometimes feel hurt when it is absent. The reason we need to distinguish trust from mere reliance is that, we have a special emotional response to trust. We value it, and we want to understand how we should deal with it.

But what is this emotion, exactly? Let us start from examining counterexamples to Baier's definition of trust. Consider the case of a "confidence trickster." Such a person relies on your goodwill to manipulate you into giving them money. However, it would be counterintuitive to say the trickster _trusts_ you to hand over your money. 

Holton’s account, centered on the "participant stance," offers a better explanation because it excludes this scenario. The "participant stance" involves an attitude of mutual collaboration and shared participation. Since there is no genuine collaboration between the trickster and their victim, this situation does not qualify as trust. 

However, it is not entirely clear why we feel betrayal when someone fails to honor the trust we place in them, while we feel disappointed when we have attitudes other than participant stance. This points to a deeper emotional aspect beyond collaboration or participation. 

While I do not wish to delve into the convoluted debate here, I want to highlight what these theories ultimately aim to capture: a sense of harmony between individuals. (The word "harmony" here is obscure, and I am positing it here just for a pre-theoretical grasp of its meaning.) We resist calling the trickster's actions an instance of trust because there is no harmony between the trickster and their victim. But harmony also involves more than participant stance. It also requires emotional connectedness. This emotional connection explains why we feel trust is more valuable than other kinds of reliance, and why breaches of trust evoke such strong feelings of hurt or betrayal. In short, Baier's account is incomplete because goodwill captures the emotional connection but does not always entail collaboration. On the other hand, Holton’s account is incomplete because it does not fully capture the emotional dimension.

My aim here, however, is not to define trust precisely. "Harmony," as I used it, remains a somewhat vague concept. Instead, I want to show why Edenic trust isn't just one type of trust among many. Even when you extend trust to an enemy, as in raising a white flag, you're anticipating a degree of shared understanding and coordinated action. You might even feel a sense of connection, viewing your enemy as reasonable or respectable for honoring the gesture. This suggests that even in seemingly adversarial trust, there's an underlying element of the harmony we associate with Edenic trust. The desire for this connection is not limited to intimate relationships. It appears to be a fundamental aspect of what makes trust meaningful, regardless of the context.

## Trust and Rationality

Given this view of trust, how should we trust, in what way, and why?

Here's a classic example from Baker, which I'll present in my own words: Imagine your closest friend is Smith. One day, the police show up at your door with compelling evidence against him: surveillance footage shows someone who looks just like Smith robbing a bank at gunpoint, and they've found his fingerprints at the scene. The police don't know where Smith is and ask you to contact them if you see him. A few days later, Smith appears at your door. He desperately claims he's been framed and had nothing to do with the robbery. The question is: should you trust his word?

Both yes and no are justifiable. On one hand, we might feel a powerful impulse to stand by our friend. When Smith tells us he's innocent, our sense of loyalty pulls us toward believing him. On the other hand, the evidence against him is substantial, suggesting we should distrust him due to the evidence.

These competing responses reflect two different types of reasoning. The former exemplifies a process of practical reasoning, which considers our relationships and commitments. The latter represents theoretical reasoning, which aims purely at truth.

Holton argues that we can rationally choose to trust Smith even while acknowledging the evidence against him, as long as we haven't definitively concluded he committed the robbery. However, Hieronymi challenges this view, contending that such trust cannot be rationally maintained. She argues that once we think about this belief, we'll find it lacks proper foundation. This is because only beliefs formed through a truth-directed process, i.e. theoretical reasoning, can withstand reflection. You will lose the belief formed by practical considerations alone under scrutiny.

How is this related to the solution of this situation? Holton argues that one can come to believe when one decides to trust. Then the action is grounded on the belief formed by one's decision to trust. Therefore, it is rational for us to trust our friend in this case. But Hieronymi argues that this cannot be rational, which implies that we should not trust our friends in this case. Dannenberg concludes that, ultimately this is the clash between our two tools of reasoning: practical reason and theoretical reason. The conflict is deep and we cannot have a solution without changing the view of rationality.

All these accounts seem to suggest that the highest goal of trust is to "trust rationally." This implies that trust must be formed through a process of justification grounded in reason. But why should that be the ultimate aim? There are clear advantages to rational trust, such as its ability to help us navigate risks and counter bad luck. But why would it be the final end?

Consider an analogy with love: We all recognize that love is valuable, yet we also know it can lead to heartbreak. This naturally leads us to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy forms of love. But it does not follow that we should therefore pursue only "rational love." There's something deeply valuable about romantic, faithful, even somewhat irrational love. Minimizing risk isn't everything – other qualities matter just as much, if not more.

Trust also shares this trait. It tends to dissolve under too much scrutiny. Consider how it would play out in Smith's case: imagine if, when he comes to you claiming innocence, you respond by saying "Let me analyze this systematically. I'll weigh our friendship, evaluate the ethical implications of trust, examine the police evidence, and create a mathematical model to reach a decision." Even if you ultimately choose to believe Smith, he would likely feel that this isn't really trust at all. 

This points to something important: the trust that we want doesn't typically involve such calculated deliberation. Trust, by definition, entails some sense of directness of emotional response. If people value trust, then they must take something other than the rationalism ideal.

The idea that everything should be pursued in its most rational form has deep roots in the philosophical tradition. It can be traced back to Plato, who argued that the ultimate good is tied to the Form—an eternal, unchanging reality accessible only through reason and knowledge. And the best life is to live in accordance with it. 

I do not aim to reject this ideal. I believe it is perfectly possible for someone with an extraordinary nature to dedicate themselves to such a life and live it well. However, for low creatures like me, I feel it is very hard to achieve this standard. To quote Aristotle, this kind of account

> "...  seems actually compatible with ... the greatest sufferings and misfortunes; but a man who was living so no one would call happy, unless he were maintaining a thesis at all costs." (_NE I.5, 1069a1)

A life governed solely by rational ideals can become detached from the realities of human experience, including our emotional and relational needs. Therefore, I wish to adopt an arationalist picture of how we should act. Reason is surely valuable, but it does not demand absolute authority over every aspect of our lives. In the end, the goal might be to serve our "heart." By "heart," I mean the core of our psychology—our intuitive, emotional, and deeply human side.

Many adopt the rationalist view because they assume the "heart" is irrational or foolish. But this assumption is flawed. It is, in fact, the heart that often initiates our reasoning process. For example, we do not consciously deliberate on whether to inhale or exhale, nor do we meticulously reflect before commanding our bodies to perform basic actions. In these moments, the rational, reflective self is absent; the heart takes the lead. When we face complex tasks, our heart instinctively knows when to defer to reasoning, allowing deliberation to guide us.

This intuitive aspect of the heart is not random or untrustworthy—it has been finely tuned by evolution to navigate the challenges of life. There is no reason to presume it is inherently foolish or inferior to reason.

Now, since trust inherently some emotional connection, whoever admits that trust is valuable must implicitly commit to the arationalist picture. For instance, Fricker argues that the ultimate ideal for us to fight against epistemic injustice is not to reflex every time. Instead, we should constantly correct ourselves and achieve a state of naiveness. Baier also argues that we cannot reduce trust into some rational contracts. Instead, rational contrasts are rooted in "infant trust."

## How should we trust

What can be inferred from this change of ultimate ideal? It means that "worrying about whether the trust is grounded by justification" is not always a worry that should be addressed. But sometimes (even most of the time) we do need to address this problem. So when should we care, and when shouldn't?

Dannenberg argues that the standard view of practical reasoning and theoretical reasoning are like two domains. One is not possible to contaminate another. He gave us an example of serving two masters:

> Suppose that your picture of parental authority involved seeing each of your parents as entitled to rule unconditionally over a distinct aspect of your life. Your mother must be listened to in all matters of career, while your father has the final say when it comes to affairs of the heart. For this to be a workable arrangement, you must be able to view the spheres of the professional and the personal as distinct and non-overlapping. Then one day you find yourself developing feelings for a co-worker. Mum says that they absolutely must not be indulged. Dad says that you absolutely must pursue them. Clearly, you have an immediate conflict on your hands that has no easy resolution. But that conflict is not resolved just by figuring out what to do here and now, for necessarily it exposes your antecedent understanding as untenable.

The relationship between practical and theoretical reasoning is more complex than a simple division into separate domains. Let's think about what practical reasoning actually involves: it's about making decisions about actions. But how can we make any decisions about our actions without some understanding of how the world works? For most goal-oriented actions, we need to understand a situation before we can decide how to act on it. This suggests that at least some part of the theoretical reasoning—our way of understanding reality—must come before practical reasoning.

The timing of when we receive information makes a crucial difference in how we process it. Consider two scenarios with your friend and the bank robbery:

Scenario 1: Your friend comes to you first, adamantly denying any involvement in the robbery. Later, when you see the evidence against them, you're more likely to stand by your friend and look for alternative explanations for the evidence.

Scenario 2: You first see the compelling evidence suggesting your friend's guilt. Then, when your friend approaches you claiming innocence, you're more likely to question their truthfulness.

What does this example teach us? It teaches us that practical reasoning can indirectly affect the reasoning process. Since there is a temporal order, the practical reasoning process will start only after the theoretical reasoning process ends. When does theoretical reasoning end? Whenever it comes to a threshold of certainty. But this threshold is context-sensitive. In the ordinary, relaxed context, one or two pieces of evidence may suffice. But in a skeptical context, you need a lot of evidence to support your conclusion. Therefore, practical reasoning may retrospectively raise or lower the default threshold of confidence so that you may reevaluate the prediction made by theoretical reasoning. Consider a routine trip to the bank: If I'm planning to deposit a check on Saturday and remember the bank being open on Saturdays two weeks ago, that single piece of evidence might feel sufficient. But context changes everything. If that check needs to be deposited before Monday to avoid serious consequences, suddenly my casual certainty doesn't feel adequate. The stakes of the practical decision (avoiding a bounced check) push me to question my theoretical conclusion (that the bank will surely be open). I may back this question by the fact that bank may change their time, so it is better to go in and make sure now.

It also teaches us that when theoretical reasoning leads to indeterminacy, the whole process may be blocked. For example, imagine you meet a robot taxi driver with a known defect - it tells the truth only 50% of the time and lies the other 50%. The robot offers to pick you up tomorrow at 8 AM to drive you to the airport for your 10 AM flight. Should you trust the robot and wait for it tomorrow morning? Or should you book a reliable Uber instead? You cannot even start to decide if you are daunted by the 50% chance. You must first start to think about one particular situation. But how can you decide which case are you considering first? You can never do it if you only allow theoretical reasoning to get involved in this process. 

Therefore, rather than conflict, it is more like a breakdown of theoretical reasoning which blocks the practical reasoning. Therefore, the analogy of serving two masters is overly dramatic. The real situation is not a conflict of domains, but more like a vacuum area unreachable by both domains. The theoretical reasoning runs into an indeterminate prediction, and the practical reasoning cannot offer help. Without further new evidence, we seem to run into a deadlock.

But we need the outcome produced by the whole reasoning procedure in order to act. For actions like trust and love, it inherently demands some directness of following your heart. If it is a justified case of indeterminacy, the thing we should do is stop worrying, accept our vulnerability and let our heart make the final call. If you are still worrying about your decision, the thing you need is not an argument but a therapy.

Now you might ask: what counts as a justified case of indeterminacy? The robot driver case clearly illustrates such a case. But what about Baker's example—does the tension between friendship and evidence qualify as indeterminacy? I think the answer depends on the situation. 

As Fricker argues, we sometimes perceive others with a credibility deficit or excess, biases that reflection can help correct. In Baker's case, we do have a responsibility to reflect on whether we might be giving undue credibility to our friends. For instance, if you realize that your friend has a history of lying to you, your sense of loyalty might naturally weaken, making the situation less indeterminate. 

However, if your bond with your friend is deeply rooted, this might lead you to critically scrutinize the evidence against them and view it with extreme skepticism. In such a case, the evidence cannot conclusively determine your friend's guilt or innocence. Here, the indeterminacy is justified. At this point that you should trust your heart and stand by your friend.
