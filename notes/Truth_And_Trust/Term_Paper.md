*The central dilemma*

In Eden, trust was unnecessary. We lived in perfect harmony, never questioning whether anything might harm us. Everything existed exactly as it should.

Then we tasted the fruit of deception. We discovered that harmony was an illusion - people could speak truth with their lips while lying in their hearts. And we tasted the fruit of fallibility, realizing our unexamined choices could lead to devastating consequences, hurting both ourselves and those we cherish. So our fell from Eden. We start to have the problem of who should we trust, and when. 

Consider how an infant enters the world in a state of pure, unquestioning trust with their parents. In this state of innocence, they naturally extend this absolute trust to all faces they encounter, believing the world operates on the same principles of unconditional love and care they experience from their mother. But then comes their first encounter with deception. This moment marks their own personal fall from Eden. The realization dawns, however unconsciously, that not all smiles carry warmth, not all gentle words speak truth, and not all who appear kind harbor good intentions.

When we want to say something about trust, we must deal with a dilemma. On the one hand, we want to make careful reflection in order not prone to error. Yet we're simultaneously drawn toward a return to Eden. We want trust to be non-reflective. This may be a longing that runs deep in our souls. We yearn to dissolve the barriers between self and other, to be loved, trusted, and cared for, because at our core, we are beings who feel incomplete alone. As Aristophanes suggested, we are like beings split in half, eternally searching for our other part. Trust becomes the bridge that can reconnect us, helping us recover some fragment of that lost wholeness.

*Baker's example*

Here's a classic example from Baker, which I'll present in my own words: Imagine your closest friend is Smith. One day, the police show up at your door with compelling evidence against him: surveillance footage shows someone who looks just like Smith robbing a bank at gunpoint, and they've found his fingerprints at the scene. The police don't know where Smith is and ask you to contact them if you see him. A few days later, Smith appears at your door. He desperately claims he's been framed and had nothing to do with the robbery. The question is: should you trust his word?

Both yes and no are justifiable. On one hand, we might feel a powerful impulse to stand by our friend. When Smith tells us he's innocent, our sense of loyalty pulls us toward believing him. On the other hand, the evidence against him is substantial, suggesting we should distrust him due to the evidence.

These competing responses reflect two different types of reasoning. The former exemplifies a process of practical reasoning, which considers our relationships and commitments. The latter represents theoretical reasoning, which aims purely at truth.

Holton argues that we can rationally choose to trust Smith even while acknowledging the evidence against him, as long as we haven't definitively concluded he committed the robbery. However, Hieronymi challenges this view, contending that such trust cannot be rationally maintained. She argues that once we think about this belief, we'll find it lacks proper foundation. This is because only beliefs formed through a truth-directed process, i.e. theoretical reasoning, can withstand reflection. You will lose the belief formed by practical considerations alone under scrutiny.

On the surface level, Holton and Hieronymi are debating about whether trusting involves belief. But this just seems trivial. In some sense, why would anyone care about whether trust involves belief or not? It seems merely verbal, since I am not reporting Smith nevertheless. Call it trust or not, it does not have any impact on my decision. 

But it will affect the judgment of my decision, i.e. whether it is rational. Holton argues that one can come to believe when one decide to trust. Then the action is grounded on the belief formed by one's deciding to trust. But Hieronymi argues that this cannot be rational. Dannenberg concludes that, ultimately this is the clash between our two tools of reasoning: practical reason and theoretical reason. The conflict is deep and we cannot have a solution without changing the view of rationality.

But all these account seems to suggest that, the highest goal for trust is to "trust rationally". But what does "trust rationally" even mean? Why would a rational trust be the best kind of trust? To the extent that rationally is about reasoning and reducing risk, this aim cannot be the ultimate goal.

Consider an analogy with love: We all recognize that love is valuable, yet we also know it can lead to heartbreak. This naturally leads us to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy forms of love. But it does not follow that we should therefore pursue only "rational love." There's something deeply valuable about romantic, faithful, even somewhat irrational love. Minimizing risk isn't everything – other qualities matter just as much, if not more.

Trust also shares this trait. It tends to dissolve under too much scrutiny. Consider how it would play out in Smith's case: imagine if, when he comes to you claiming innocence, you respond by saying "Let me analyze this systematically. I'll weigh our friendship, evaluate the ethical implications of trust, examine the police evidence, and create a mathematical model to reach a decision." Even if you ultimately choose to believe Smith, he would likely feel that this isn't really trust at all. While his reaction alone doesn't definitively prove this isn't trust at all, it points to something important: genuine trust doesn't typically involve such calculated deliberation. Again, this stems from our ednic urge to blur the boundary between self and other - we come to see ourselves and the trusted person as fundamentally connected. This reflects a deep human longing to overcome what Japanese culture calls "心の壁" (the wall of hearts) - the psychological and emotional barriers that separate us from others.

Many people implicitly expressed this ideal in their theory. Fricker argues that the ultimate ideal for us to fight against epistemic injustice is not to reflex every time. Instead, we should constantly correct ourselves and achieve a state of naiveness. Baier also argues that the real model of trust is the "infant trust."


What can be inferred from this change of ultimate ideal? It means that "worrying about whether the trust is grounded or not" is not always a worry that should be addressed. But sometimes (even most of the time) we do need to address this problem. So when should we care, and when shouldn't?

Dannenberg argues that the standard view of practical reasoning and theoretical reasoning are like two domains. One is not possible to contaminate another. He gave us an example of serving two masters:

> Suppose that your picture of parental authority involved seeing each of your parents as entitled to rule unconditionally over a distinct aspect of your life. Your mother must be listened to in all matters of career, while your father has the final say when it comes to affairs of the heart. For this to be a workable arrangement, you must be able to view the spheres of the professional and the personal as distinct and non-overlapping. Then one day you find yourself developing feelings for a co-worker. Mum says that they absolutely must not be indulged. Dad says that you absolutely must pursue them. Clearly, you have an immediate conflict on your hands that has no easy resolution. But that conflict is not resolved just by figuring out what to do here and now, for necessarily it exposes your antecedent understanding as untenable.

The relationship between practical and theoretical reasoning is more complex than a simple division into separate domains. Let's think about what practical reasoning actually involves: it's about making decisions about future actions. But how can we make any decisions about the future without some understanding of how the world works? For most goal-oriented actions, we need to understand a situation before we can decide how to act on it. This suggests that theoretical reasoning—our way of understanding reality—must come before practical reasoning.

The timing of when we receive information makes a crucial difference in how we process it. Consider two scenarios with your friend and the bank robbery:

Scenario 1: Your friend comes to you first, adamantly denying any involvement in the robbery. Later, when you see the evidence against them, you're more likely to stand by your friend and look for alternative explanations for the evidence.

Scenario 2: You first see the compelling evidence suggesting your friend's guilt. Then, when your friend approaches you claiming innocence, you're more likely to question their truthfulness.

What does the temporal order of reasoning teach us? It teaches us that practical reasoning can indirectly affect the reasoning process. Since there is a temporal order, the practical reasoning process will start only after theoretical reasoning process ends. When does theoretical reasoning end? Whenever it comes to a threshold of certainty. But this threshold is context-sensitive. In the ordinary, relaxed context, one or two pieces of evidence may suffice. But in a skeptical context, you need a lot of evidence to support your conclusion. Therefore, practical reasoning may retrospectively raise up or lower the default threshold of confidence so that you may reevaluate the prediction made by theoretical reasoning. Consider a routine trip to the bank: If I'm planning to deposit a check on Saturday and remember the bank being open on Saturdays two weeks ago, that single piece of evidence might feel sufficient. But context changes everything. If that check needs to be deposited before Monday to avoid serious consequences, suddenly my casual certainty doesn't feel adequate. The stakes of the practical decision (avoiding a bounced check) push me to question my theoretical conclusion (that the bank will surely be open). I may back this question by the fact that bank may change their time, so it is better to go in and make sure now.


It also teaches us that when theoretical reasoning leads to indeterminacy, the whole process may be blocked. For example, imagine you meet a robot taxi driver with a known defect - it tells the truth only 50% of the time and lies the other 50%. The robot offers to pick you up tomorrow at 8 AM to drive you to the airport for your 10 AM flight. Should you trust the robot and wait for it tomorrow morning? Or should you book a reliable Uber instead? You cannot even start to decide if you are daunted by the 50% chance. You must first start to think about one particular situation. But how can you decide which case are you considering first? You can never do it if you only allow theoretical reasoning get involved in this process. 

Therefore, rather than conflict, it is more like a breakdown of theoretical reasoning which blocks the practical reasoning. Therefore, the analogy of serving two masters is overly dramatic. The real situation is not a conflict of domains, but more like a vacuum area unreachable by both domains. The theoretical reasoning runs into an indeterminate prediction, and the practical reasoning cannot offer help. Without further new evidence, we seems to run into a deadlock.

But we need the outcome produced by the whole reasoning procedure in order to act. I am not saying that, in order to reach an outcome we should accept some solution called "follow your heart". But for actions like trust and love, it inherently demand some directness of "following your heart". If it is a real case of indeterminacy, the thing we should do is to stop worrying, accept our vulnerability and "follow your heart." If you are worrying about it, the thing you need is not an argument but a therapy.

But this is a merely descriptive account. But still it haven't tell us how should we trust. Two things can be said. We can reflect on whether we set the threshold with prejudice or not. As Fricker argues, we sometimes perceive people with credibility deficit or excess, which may be corrected by reflection. In the case mentioned earlier, we can reflect and realize that we may give credibility excess to our friend. And the Hieronymi is right in saying that you cannot believe that your friend is innocent. But it is also possible that the process of reflection gives you the chance to reexamine the evidence and find some loophole in it. Then it would be a breakdown case.

When the theoretical reasoning breakdown, practical reasoning take the final call. This is not because it has higher hierarchy, but it is just that we must decide what to. Consider there is a bomb is exploding in 10s and there are two people who both claim he can dismiss the bomb. But one is really an expert but another is a sociopath. And one look poor and one look rich. Whoever dismiss the boom is going to get a lot of money as reward. It is clear that theoretical reasoning cannot do anything but to breakdown. But (for the sake of the argument) it is good to give money to the poor. Then it seems okay to act in this way.
