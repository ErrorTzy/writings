**Definition (practice)**: Any form of activity specified by a system of rules which gives activity its structure.

**Goal**: Distinction between justifying a practice and justifying a particular action.

**Importance of the Goal**: Utilitarianism is often accused of not aligning with our moral judgements. If we can make this distinction, then we can form utilitarianism that is immune to this criticism

## Part I

**Question**: How should we reconcile two different justifications of punishment?

1. Intuitive justification: Wrongdoing merits(deserves) punishment. (*Utilitarians cannot take 1* because moral only depends on future consequences.)
	- Guilt/An eye for an eye
2. Utilitarianism must argue that punishment produce good future consequences like maintaining social order.

**Rawls' Answer**: The conflict is resolved by saying that the first is justifying particular cases, while the second is justifying a system of rules.

Consider two linguistic practices:

(i) "Why was J put in jail yesterday"? "Because he robbed the bank"
(ii) "Why do people put other people in jail"? "Because we need to protect good people from bad people"
