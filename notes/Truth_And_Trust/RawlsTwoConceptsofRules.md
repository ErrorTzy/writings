**Definition (practice)**: Any form of activity specified by a system of rules which gives activity its structure.

**Goal**: Distinction between justifying a practice and justifying a particular action.

**Importance of the Goal**: Utilitarianism is often accused of not aligning with our moral judgements. If we can make this distinction, then we can form utilitarianism that is immune to this criticism

## Part I

**Problem with Utilitarianism**: We want to say that, punishment occurs when you already did something bad. But utilitarianism evaluate actions based on the harm you will cause in the future. Therefore, if someone haven't done anything but will cause harm in the future, utilitarianism need to find a way to say they are free from punishment. How should we reconcile this?

- **Defense**: Punishment should only be imposed after someone breaks the law
	- **Objection**: How can you defend such a principle within utilitarianism' framework?
	- **Defense 1**: The semantics of punishment has already included that, it happens after someone breaks the law.
		- **Objection**: This does not prevent you from harming an innocent person for the greater good. You just stop calling it punishment. You still need to justify why this kind of behavior is prohibited.
	- **Defense 2**: 

Proposition 1

:  There is a distinction between the judge's and legislator's position with respect to the legal system.

**Proof**: Consider two linguistic practices:

(i) "Why was J put in jail yesterday"? "Because he robbed the bank"
(ii) "Why do people put other people in jail"? "Because we need to protect good people from bad people"

The first explanation is appealing to laws (If someone robs the bank, then put them in jail); The second is asking why the law is like this.

> Internal/External?

Proposition 2

: *Proposition 1* does not reconcile the conflict

**Proof**: If the judges takes (1) and legislators takes (2) as their consideration, then proposition 1 reconciles the conflict. But a person in judges' position doesn't necessarily only consider that wrongdoing merits punishment. Therefore, *proposition 1* does not automatically reconciles the question.

> If a judge only takes (1), then when you think someone is unjustly judged according to the law, you are not entitled to ask whether this particular judgement is right, but you should ask the legislator whether the law itself is right. This seems to be a possible position, but Rawls rejects it by citing David Ross, The Right and the Good, pp. 57-60 



Definition: Summary rules

~  "rules of thumb;‚Äù They collect results of similar instances: In situations of type S, do A 
~ The instances are thus prior to the rule.  They do not depend on the rule; rather, the rule depends on them.

Definition: Practice rules

: define the actions they regulate; The rule is thus prior to the instances. Without the rule, there could be no actions of the type in question.
