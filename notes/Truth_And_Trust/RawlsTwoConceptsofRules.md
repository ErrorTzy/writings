**Definition (practice)**: Any form of activity specified by a system of rules which gives activity its structure.

**Goal**: Distinction between justifying a practice and justifying a particular action.

**Importance of the Goal**: Utilitarianism is often accused of not aligning with our moral judgements. If we can make this distinction, then we can form utilitarianism that is immune to this criticism

How should we justify punishment?

1. Intuitive justification: Wrongdoing merits(deserves) punishment
	- Guilt/An eye for an eye
2. Utilitarian principle cannot take 1 because moral only depends on future consequences. Utilitarianism must argue that punishment produce good future consequences like maintaining social order.
