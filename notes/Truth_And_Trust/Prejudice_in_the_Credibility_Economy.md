Prejudice corrupts hearers' judgments. How do we form prejudice?

Prejudice is stereotype that we make use of as heuristics in our credibility judgements.

Conceptual Analysis on Stereotype:

*Definition*: Stereotype is a widely held associations between a given social group and one or more attributes.

Remark: This definition is broad in three ways:
1. It does not restrict if it is a correct association `Can there be any correct association?`
2. It does not restrict if it is a belief. It could be an inclination of attitude.
3. It does not restrict if it is complimentary, derogatory, or neutral.

Degrees in generalization:
1. All women are intuitive
2. Most women are intuitive
3. Many women are intuitive


Useful heuristic stereotype vs. Prejudicial stereotype:
- Useful heuristic aid: important for our everyday testimony exchange. E.g. family doctor
- Prejudicial Stereotype:
    - Unreliable empirical generalization `what does it mean by unreliable and wrong? What if at some point all women are indeed intuitive?`
    - Not because of epistemic bad luck, but **pre-judgment** without proper regard to the evidence, and the context is not requiring one to have exceptional epistemic character;     `Why bad epistemic context could count as an escape from culpability? She said she will defend it in Ch. 4`

*Definition:* Prejudices are judgments which: 
- may have a positive or negative valence, and which 
- display some resistance to counter-evidence owing to some investment (which may be either positive or negative) on the part of the subject


*Definition*: **Negative identity-prejudicial Stereotype** is a widely held disparaging association between a social group and one or more attributes, where the association embodies a generalization that displays some (typically epistemically culpable) resistance to counter-evidence to an ethically bad affective investment.

Perception of credibility:
The hearer perceive the speaker as trust worthy; The identity-prejudicial stereotype distort the perception
More frequently we form prejudice not because of belief but something stealthier, i.e. image. `What's that?`
Image has a visceral impact on judgment.
