Social Power:
1. *Agential Power*: Capacity of social agents that influence how things goes in social world

- operates actively: when you actual use your power
- operates passively: when others realize the fact that you have the power

Remark: 
Fricker asserts that power exists even when it is passive *and not really taking effect*. 
Foucault is wrong because power is a capacity, not something that comes into and out of existence.
But Fricker is not rejecting Foucault on the point that power is 'net-like'

2. *Structural Power*: Capacity of social structure, i.e. no particular agent exercising it, that influence how things goes in social world

> Ideology?


One form of social power: identity power, also can be used actively or passively
E.g. Gender

Systematic testimonial injustice vs. local testimonial injustice: The former tracks the subject on every social aspect.
(Social) identity prejudice is the systematic type.
central case: identity-prejudicial credibility deficit (only some identities are systematic)
