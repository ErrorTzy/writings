# 1. Definition

**western history:**

- historically an economic and political unit
- love revolution in 18th centry
- consent is agreed, but child marriage challenges it (arranged marriage is compatible with consent)

**worldwide**

- multiple forms, including same-sex, polygamy, "common law" marriage, restriction on incest, civil marriage, ...

Some argued that marriage has no essential purpose or structure, but being only a "family resemblance" concept

> even if there is no essential feature of the marriage in practice, it does not follow that we cannot recognize marriage by law.
> First, law can be related to nomos. Second, law can create its own concepts like "rights" and grant it to the people it permits.
> This approach mistakes the question "what marriage should be" with "what marriage is"

We should not appeal to actual legal or social definitions because

1. past applications of a term is neither a necessary nor a sufficient criteria
2. sometimes circular, i.e. defining marriage as spouse and defining spouse as marriage
3. begs the question (?)

# 2. Historical Development

## 2.1. Political and Economical Unit

**Plato**: "communitarian marriage"
**Aristotle**: natural procreative union of male and female; male's virtue in commanding, female's virtue in obeying

## 2.2. Permitting Sex　

**Augustine**: Procreation is the purpose of marriage, and sex for procreation is not sinful; protect against temptation and keep fidelity
**Aquinas**: Marriage is good for child rearing; sex is a loss of reason thus bad, but it is compensated by the goods; fidelity and partnership of a common life

> Why need marriage for procreation/child-rearing?

## 2.3. Love:

**Heloise**: it is not an economic transaction since it is not "prostitute herself to a rich man"; instead it is based on love and friendship
**Kierkegaard**: This creates a tension: is marriage the cage of erotic/romantic love, or enables spousal love

> This is slightly different from what Aristotle argued

Traditional: based on sexual difference
Early Modern: doctrine of equal rights and contract

## 2.4. Contracts:

**Hobbes**: Men's power is not always superior than women, but normally men prevail
**Locke**: Rest on consent, is a voluntary compact; the rule naturally falls into man's hand (attack from Mary Astell)
**Rousseau**: different virtue for man and woman (attack from Wollstonecraft)

Raises question: why marital obligation is fixed?

## 2.5. Normative Principles

**Kant**: sex is treating other human beings as means, but the agreement of marriage make this process reciprocal and thus restores the personality
Kant's arguments were reconstructed by feminists and defenders of same-sex marriage
**Hegel**: criticize Kant, love is not contractual, but based on ethical love; give up natural and individual personality within this union

> It seems that Hegel does not need a child?

## 2.6. Feminism and Marxism

**Mill**: marriage `empirically` is the slavery of woman; woman do not have choice other than marriage. Ideal marriage should have equal relationship and this equality would be a school of justice for children.
**Engels**: monogamy is the defeat of woman, the victory of private property over natural communal property
**Marx**: abolishing family will liberate women

# 3. Ethical Views of Marriage

## 3.1. Contractual Views:

### 3.1.1. Features:

1. obligations only from promise
2. morally arbitrary, diverse

Normal account: social and legal practice as default, but spouses can release one another from these moral obligation
E.g. **Fidelity** is a default obligation, but spouses can free each other from this.

### 3.1.2. Problems:

**unilateral divorce**:
if marriage entails the promise to stay married, then unilateral divorce seems problematic

possible response:

1. there are more stringent moral duties that permits unilateral divorce
2. marriage must based on love or sex (not favorable if not explicitly stated as obligation in contract)
3. marriage does not promise to stay married, but only stay married to do good to their children (parental duty)

**amatory obligation**
Do marriage demand that spouse **behave** as if they love each other, or they **psychologically** love each other, or else?

The former option seems counterintuitive, but the second answer will run into another question: if there is a pill that can make someone psychologically fall in love with someone, will you take it

> implying the third option?

### 3.1.3. Objections:

**Is any arbitrary contract a marriage contract?**

Response

1. Marriage is irrational: Marriage is irrational
2. Marriage is rational but subjective.
   1. However from the institutional perspective, if it is rational, it is objective

**Voluntarism**

Voluntarism seems wrong because not all duties are voluntary. i.e. filial duties

Response:

1. even if filial duties are not voluntary, spousal duties can be voluntary
2. voluntarism does not entail contractual views. Contractual view emphasize on the subjectivity of the agreement, while voluntarism emphasize on the fact that everything must be voluntary. It is possible for voluntarist marriage subject to institutional view.

## 3.2. Institutional Views:

### 3.2.1. New Natural Law

#### 3.2.1.1. Marriage as procreation

the good (purpose) of marriage is reproduction and fides

##### 3.2.1.1.1. Problems

**inconsistencies**

if law is to forbid "bad marriage" for the sake of human goods, then it should also forbid things like eating healthily

**counterexamples for common dogma**

non-marital sex, i.e. masturbation or contracepted sex can be good

**why is infertile marriage permitted?**

"type theory", but not convincing at all

**problem with standard definition**

standard definition: marriage is the union of life, mind, body, etc.
problem: why is bodily union is so important?

#### 3.2.1.2. Alternative: Goldstein's theory

### 3.2.2. Marriage as Protecting Love

the purpose of marriage is to protect sexual love relationship
leads to obligations that protects love and excludes incompatible options

#### 3.2.2.1. Problems:

**Controversial principles**

some argues that extra-marital or polyamory is advantageous to marriage

**Do we really need marriage for love?**

because if a couple is in love, they do not need marriage to have love; if a couple is not in love, they are trapped in a loveless marriage

**marriage cannot protect love since divorce is possible**

### 3.2.3. Marriage as virtue fosterer

Understood as Ulysses contract

# 4. Political Understandings of Marriage Law

## 4.1. anomaly of marriage

1. according to the contractual view, there should have been no law for marriage
2. the state interferes personal decision：
   1. it brings special privileges for marriage
   2. there are restrictions on entry or exit
   3. the content of obligations are fixed
3. Therefore, the anomaly needs to be explained

relationship between marriage and legal rights:

1. freedom of contract is compatible with exploitation and oppression
2. rights should not be the marriage itself but a protection when the affection fails


## 4.2. The Rationale of Marriage Law

- Why is there such thing as marriage?
   - the monogamous heterosexual family is a natural structure
     - **REF**: irrelevant for legislation because law need not to follow nature, since nature may be oppressive
   - marriage protects/guides a valuable life
     - **REF**: Why it is valuable at all?
       - it is a time enduring tradition, thus it has proven its value
         - **REF**: tradition can have negative components, i.e. rape exemptions, and in a diverse society, there can be multiple traditions that incompatible with each other.
       - a monogamous marriage encourages sexual self-control needed for health and happiness; goods of love and intimacy, etc
     - **REF**: The state should not interfere way of life but instead should stay neutral.
       - even if with this neutrality of way of life, marriage protects autonomy, relationship and children
         - **REF**: marriage may not do benefit to children; what should be used for addressing children issue should not be marriage but other programs
       - marriage makes better citizens because children empirically speaking has better psychological and economical status
         -
