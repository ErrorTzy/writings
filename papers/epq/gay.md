1. Why marriage is not between husband and wife, but between couple and the government? "清官难断家务事"
2. why marriage should be restricted to unions between men and women


# Contractual Views:

## Features:

1. obligations only from promise
2. morally arbitrary, diverse

normal account: social and legal practice as default, but spouses can release one another from these moral obligation
E.g. **Fidelity** is a default obligation, but spouses can free each other from this.


## Problems:

**unilateral divorce**:
if marriage entails the promise to stay married, then unilateral divorce seems problematic

possible response:
1. there are more stringent moral duties that permits unilateral divorce
2. marriage must based on love or sex (not favorable if not explicitly stated as obligation in contract)
3. marriage does not promise to stay married, but only stay married to do good to their children (parental duty)

**amatory obligation**
Do marriage demand that spouse **behave** as if they love each other, or they **psychologically** love each other, or else?

The former option seems counterintuitive, but the second answer will run into another question: if there is a pill that can make someone psychologically fall in love with someone, will you take it

> implying the third option?

## Objections:

**Is any arbitrary contract a marriage contract?**

Response

1. Marriage is irrational: Marriage is irrational
2. Marriage is rational but subjective.
   1. However from the institutional perspective, if it is rational, it is objective

**Voluntarism**

Voluntarism seems wrong because not all duties are voluntary. i.e. filial duties

Response:

1. even if filial duties are not voluntary, spousal duties can be voluntary
2. voluntarism does not entail contractual views. Contractual view emphasize on the subjectivity of the agreement, while voluntarism emphasize on the fact that everything must be voluntary. It is possible for voluntarist marriage subject to institutional view.

# Institutional Views:

## New Natural Law

### Marriage as procreation

the good (purpose) of marriage is reproduction and fides

#### Problems

**inconsistencies**

if law is to forbid "bad marriage" for the sake of human goods, then it should also forbid things like eating healthily

**counterexamples for common dogma**

non-marital sex, i.e. masturbation or contracepted sex can be good

**why is infertile marriage permitted?**

"type theory", but not convincing at all

**problem with standard definition**

standard definition: marriage is the union of life, mind, body, etc.
problem: why is bodily union is so important?

### Alternative: Goldstein's theory

## Marriage as Protecting Love

the purpose of marriage is to protect sexual love relationship
leads to obligations that protects love and excludes incompatible options

### Problems:

**Controversial principles**

some argues that extra-marital or polyamory is advantageous to marriage

**Do we really need marriage for love?**

because if a couple is in love, they do not need marriage to have love; if a couple is not in love, they are trapped in a loveless marriage

**Marriage cannot protect love since divorce is possible**
