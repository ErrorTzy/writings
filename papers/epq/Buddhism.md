# Chan Buddhism

Founder of the Hangzhou lineage: Mazu Daoyi

Reaffirmation of the primacy of the embodied prectice.


- does not enter the mud of conceptual thinking because ultimately thinking is irrelavent to the realization of truth
  - 慧能, the sixth patriarch proclaimed "without thinking (无念)" as the core doctrine
- does not seek help from supermundane source
- does not require extensive study or training
- everything has buddha-nature, and the only thing we need to do is to rediscover our own Buddha-nature through day-to-day lives
- four-fold phrasing:
  - a special transmission outside the scriptures (教外别传)
  - not established upon words and letters (不立文字)
  - directly pointing to human heartmind (直指人心)
  - seeing nature and becoming a buddha (见性成佛)
