\section{Northern Myanmar's Strife: A Historical View}

The political situation in northern Myanmar has always been chaotic. By the time this paper is being written, Myanmar has just went through a political unrest, labelled as \textit{Operation 1027}. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, composed of the Arakan Army, Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, and Taâ€™ang National Liberation Army, rebelled against the junta and seized Shan State.\autocite{yunsunOperation1027Changing2024} This operation's impact even extended beyond Shan State, inspiring offensives in other regions such as Kachin and Sagaing.

\subsection{The pre-colonial history of Myanmar}

The nature of southeast asian politics itself has its own character, which \textcite{tambiahGalacticPolity2007} called ``The Galactic Polity''. The concept of the mandala plays a key role in this ancient organizational blueprint. A mandala is a kind of map that shows how everything in the universe is connected, with the most important parts placed in the center. In the kingdoms of ancient Southeast Asia, the king's palace was the center of everything, much like the sun is the center of our solar system. Around the palace, like planets orbiting the sun, were the homes of nobles, temples, and the homes of common people, each placed according to their importance in society.~\autocite{tambiahGalacticPolity2007}
