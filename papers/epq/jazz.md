## History of Jazz

Public slave dance/ring shout: African ritual to the native soil of the New world (Congo Square in New Orleans)

- till 1885

the ritual shapes collective memory in black community

syncretism

The mixture:

Latin influence:

- musicological: Mexican compositions
- cultural: Latin-Catholic culture is more tolerant in accepting unorthodox social hybrids

Multicultural influence:

- immigrants from Germany, Italy, Ireland and Scotland

Original African culture:

- minstrel shows: a black imitation of a white caricature of black music
- shared characteristics:
  - call-and-response
  - integration of performance into social fabric
  - music and dance
  - focus on sounds in instance, instead of notes (very rich vocabulary)
  - improvisation and spontaneity
  - (**CORE**) richness of rhythmic content


Discipline:

work song: native african work ethics


Dionysian:

Blues:
- from African American communities
- the repeating twelve-bar pattern, both major and minor third, use C E# B#, "disconsonant", slight tension
- some suggest that reconcile an african pentatonic scale with western diatonic scale
