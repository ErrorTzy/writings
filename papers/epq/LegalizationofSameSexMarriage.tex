\section{Introduction}
In 1973, Kant wrote an essay to reject a common saying: ``That may be correct in theory, but it is of no use in practice''.~\autocite{kantCommonSayingThat2009} But here we are going to discuss a problem in the reversed order --- Something may be useful in practice, but is it correct in theory? 

Same-sex marriage has been a trend in recent years, as shown in figure~\ref{Cumu}. Up to 2022, 32 countries has allowed the marriage of gay and les. Especially, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 41 countries and territories are listed as ``advanced economies'', in which 21, that is more than a half, has legalized same-sex marriage within 20 years. If we believe these developed countries are the future of most countries, we can say that, practically speaking, same-sex marriage is likely to be a trend in the future.

Indeed, at the first glance, there seems no problem with this trend. If the function of marriage is the legal recognition of loving, then the exclusion of same-sex marriage seems arbitrary. No one seems to get hurt while the minorities are benefited. What a good deal! However, if we look closer, the problem we suggest rises. There are several counterarguments against same-sex marriage. In this paper, I will argue that ...

\section{Arguments against same-sex marriage}

According to \textcite{brakeMarriageDomesticPartnership2023}, same-sex marriage faces multiple challenges. In this section, I will ...

\subsection{Argument from alternative}
\label{alternative}

In the countries that do not promit same-sem marriage, for instance mainland China, sexual minorities can have the same rights as those who are married by signing a civil agreement. Countries like Italy has also passed the legal status of civil union.\autocite{povoledoItalyApprovesSameSex2016} Then why bother modifying marriage? 

It is problematic for at least three reasons. First, legalizing same-sex marriage pragmatically saves trouble. It is much easier to keep refining the definition of marriage itself than introducing an altogether new type of legal union. In most legal frameworks and policies, reference is made exclusively to marriage. Consider, for example, the case of a person lying incapacitated and facing major surgery. Normally, a hospital would accept only the closest relations or a spouse as the decision makers for that patient. Changing the definition of marriage would only leave existing laws in place, hence not require enormous changes in the legal code. Otherwise, where a new category of a relationship is to be put in place, then there would be a need for major amendments across many laws, as this only recognizes marriage as the form of the relationship. Thus, from a practical standpoint, amending the notion of marriage is a more efficient approach. 

Second, it is theoretically implausible. If marriage and civil union are exactly the same, despite the former one is heterosexual and the latter homosexual, and since we don't separate marriages by other factors, like race or class, why do so based on gender? Some may reply that, by definition, marriage means the heterosexual form. However, as we will see in the next section, it is implausible to say so. 

In addition, such distinction is compatible with social injustice. Logically speaking, distinguishing one thing from another does not necessarily follow that they are unequal. For instance, red is different from green, but they are equally colors. But how the government symbolically recognizes them indeed could affect how people look at them. As \textcite{mohrLongArcJustice2007} argues, reserving the term ``marriage'' only for heterosexuals while offering ``civil unions'' to same-sex couples serves to degrade gay men and lesbians by denying them access to an important social form that marks membership in full humanity. The reasoning is that marriage as a social form and ritual has profound cultural and symbolic significance beyond just the legal aspects. \Citeauthor{mohrLongArcJustice2007} believe that being denied access to ``marriage'' implies that same-sex relationships are inferior or less worthy. I do not think this argument can go this far. Nevertheless, providing an alternative is indeed compatible with discrimination and is less effective to reduce social injustice comparing with legalizing same-sex marriage.


\subsection{Argument from linguistic definition}

As mentioned in \ref{alternative}, some would argue that by linguistic definition, marriage means the heterosexual monogamous relationship. For instance, according to the American Heritage Dictionary, marriage is ``The legal union of a man and woman as husband and wife''.~\autocite{pickertAmericanHeritageDictionary2000} But we need to ask further: how do we know whether a definition of anything is true? If we ask what is a triangle, we may reply that it is a closed, three-sided polygon in a two-dimensional plane. We know this is true because we believe we have already known what a triangle is in a first place. Given the definition does not lead to any instance that we do not believe to be triangles, the definition is agreed to be true. What matters here is that, the definition of triangle does not come before our understanding of a triangle. Only have we some understanding of a triangle in the first place, can we determine if the definition is true or not. As of marriage, our understanding of what marriage should be precedes the normative definition of marriage. Therefore, we cannot answer what marriage should be by appealing to the existing definition.

\subsection{Argument from reproduction}

Another classical argument against same-sex marriage is that the purpose of marriage is procreation. Since only a male and a female together can procreate, proponents of this view argue that only heterosexual marriage should be permitted. This argument may have its roots in natural law theory, but examining the foundations of natural law would far exceed the scope of this paper. Instead, I will focus on a practical problem with this argument. If procreation is the sole purpose of marriage, then infertile couples should not be allowed to marry, since they cannot have children. This logic would also extend to fertile couples who choose not to have children. Natural Lawyers, like \textcite{leeMarriageProcreationSameSex2008} defended that marriage is a multi-leveled personal union that is fulfilled by expanding into family through procreation, but remains good in itself even if procreation is not possible in a particular case. An infertile man and woman who marry still fulfill the conditions of marriage by 

\begin{enumerate}
\item {committing to the type of union that would be fulfilled by bearing and raising children together, and}
\item {performing the biological act of becoming ``one flesh'' through intercourse, even if other non-behavioral conditions prevent actual procreation.}
\end{enumerate}

Regarding condition A, an infertile man and woman can make this commitment in the same way that a fertile couple can because it is still a union that is naturally ordered towards procreation, even if procreation does not actually happen for them due to factors beyond their control. In contrast, as \Citeauthor{leeMarriageProcreationSameSex2008} argues, a same-sex relationship is necessarily disconnected from procreation. Regarding condition B, when an infertile man and woman engage in sexual intercourse, they still perform the kind of act that unites them biologically and makes them ``one flesh''. It is a \textit{type} of act that is towards reproduction. A same-sex couple, \Citeauthor{leeMarriageProcreationSameSex2008} claims, cannot unite biologically in this way through their sexual acts.

\Citeauthor{leeMarriageProcreationSameSex2008}'s arguments, I believe, are very bad. First, it is not at all clear why the infertile couple's sexual intercourse is still oriented to the bearing and raising of children in principle. Second, there is no reason to believe that bodily union is so important so that without which marriage could not take place. Even if so, it does not follow that the penile-vaginal sex is the only way to achieve bodily union.

In addition, procreation can happen outside marriage. It seems that, the only reason procreation should happen within marriage is that it is beneficial to child-rearing. Thus we come to the next section. 

\subsection{Argument from child-rearing}

Another argument is that, marriage includes the obligation of protecting and educating children. Parents tends to have stronger connection with their own child than adopted ones. \textcite{somervilleCaseSameSexMarriage2012} contends that recognizing same-sex marriage would normalize situations where a child is intentionally deprived of either a mother or father from the outset. In her view, while there can be legitimate exceptions where same-sex couples raise children, this should be regarded as a special case. This argument, however, is only empirical and can be weakened by counterexamples. As \textcite{murphySameSexMarriageNot2011} responds, children raised by same-sex couples can still live well without raised by biological parents. \Citeauthor{murphySameSexMarriageNot2011} gives the example of a child being raised by an aunt and uncle after the biological parents die. While the child may feel a sense of loss, if the aunt and uncle treat the child well, the child can still have a good life. As long as the children have reasonable opportunities to pursue meaningful lives, Murphy argues their moral rights have not been violated by being raised by same-sex parents.
