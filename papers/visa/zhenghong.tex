\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I, Zhenghong Qu (曲征洪), am writing this letter in support of the visa application of my son, Zongyuan Tang (汤宗元). In support of his journey, I have transferred an amount of 30,000 yuan to my son`s bank account (Account No. 6217001180023025581). This fund is intended to cover his travel expenses, daily living costs, and any other expenses that may arise during his two-week stay in London. In case of any emergencies or unforeseen circumstances, I have also prepared a sum of 100,000 yuan in my own account (Account No. 4367421215474560830).

I kindly request that you consider his application favorably and grant him the visa required for his travel.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.



\closing{Sincerely,\\
