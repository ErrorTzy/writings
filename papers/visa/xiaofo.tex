\opening{To whom it may concern,}

My name is Xiaofo Wang (Passport No.: EA2392786). I am currently a full-time postgraduate student studying Comparative Literature at University College London. I now live in a student accommodation provided by Urbanest House, Kings Cross. 

I am writing this letter to invite my boyfriend Zongyuan Tang (Passport No.: EF5466359) to visit the UK. His stay will last from 12 June 2024 to 25 June 2024. During his stay, I will sponsor him by paying for our accommodation booked from airbnb.

By the time this letter is written, it has been nearly 6 months since I last saw him in China. We both miss each other and look forward to this reunion. I hope he will be granted a visiting visa to the UK.

Thank you for your time on this letter.
