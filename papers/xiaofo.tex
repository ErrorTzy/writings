To whom it may concern,

My name is Xiaofo Wang (Passport No.: EA2392786). I am currently a full-time postgraduate student studying Comparative Literature at University College London. I now live in a student accommodation provided by Urbanest House, Kings Cross. 
I am writing this letter to invite my boyfriend Zongyuan Tang (Passport No.: EF5466359) to visit the UK. His stay will last from 12 June 2024 to 25 June 2024. It has been nearly 6 months since I last saw him in China, and we both miss each other and look forward to this reunion. 
I hope he will be granted a visiting visa to the UK.
Thank you for your time on this letter.

Best regards,
Xiaofo Wang
