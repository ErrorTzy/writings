The personal statement serves a very specific function in the application; it tells those reading the
application (a) what topics you want to focus on in graduate school and (b) why we should
expect you to flourish if you focus on those topics in our program. Those reading the personal
statement will also be thinking about our program is a good fit given what you say in (a), which
is a part of assessing (b).
It is also nice to get a little window into who you are, particularly if how you came to the topics
you are interested in is relevant to (b) why we should expect you to flourish in working on these
topics. Maybe you bring something distinctive to them, based on your education or life
experience.
But the personal statement is not a place to try to convince us that you love philosophy (we
assume you do!), or that you have been aiming toward a Philosophy PhD your whole life
(surprising! implausible?), or that you can’t imagine doing anything else (depressing!).
Also, I have 400 of these to read. Don’t make it hard to figure out what topics you want to work
on. Indeed, I would start the personal statement by saying: “My main philosophical interests are
X, Y, and Z.”
X, Y, and Z should be relatively broad, even just established subfields of philosophy (e.g.,
political philosophy, moral philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, etc.). Avoid being
excessively narrow; it makes you seem somewhat philosophically incurious if you seem like you
only have an interest in one super-specific thing.
Ideally, at least 2/3 of the areas you mention should be things that our program is strong in, so
that the fit is clear. Be wary of listing things that we have no coverage of at all. It will make it
seem like you would be happier somewhere else. If you list such areas, you should reveal
awareness that we don’t focus on those areas.
After identifying your interests, the rest of the personal statement should be aimed at making the
case that you will flourish if you work on those topics. This often involves detailing work
you’ve already done in those areas—classes taken, papers or theses written, relevant empirical
fields you’ve studied, etc. This is where we can see if you seem to know something about what
you are getting yourself into.
A peek behind the scenes… The personal statement helps us to categorize you. That informs
who I will assign to read your application. If you say ‘metaphysics’ I will give you to one of the
metaphysics people on the committee. It also helps us with class balance. We can’t enroll 7
people all of whom work on philosophy of language (or whatever). This is bad for advising
purposes and for job market purposes on the other side.
Many of us like to think of ourselves as philosophers, not just philosophers of mind, or language,
or ethicists, or whatever. But there are still these practical purposes. You will end up writing
dissertations on a particular topic, not all of philosophy. But it is nice to see people with
somewhat broad and interesting X, Y, and Zs, as long as the fit is there.
Some people like to help explain why they will flourish working on a topic at Rutgers by
mentioning some names of those of us at Rutgers who work on that topic, how they have read
and liked that work, etc. Should you name names? I’m of two minds about this.
The case for doing it: it reveals knowledge of the department (congratulations, you can use the
World Wide Web), it makes fit with the department clear, and for most of us, we still feel a little
positive buzz when we see our name listed.
The case against doing it: we already know who is on our faculty, there is the danger of leaving
off someone relevant (who might be on the committee! yikes!), there is the danger of including
someone who no longer wants anything to do with that topic (or, at other departments only of
course, someone who no one should want to work with), the positive buzz thing is kind of icky
and it shouldn’t work even if it does.
So, the choice is yours. If you are going to name names, do your homework. (Look at who has
been advising students from the placement page. Look at the websites of professors to see what
they are working on now, not just 20 years ago.)
If you don’t name names, you should still think about how what you are discussing fits with our
program. Some people say something generic like “Rutgers would be an excellent place to
pursue these interests, given the Philosophy Department’s strengths and coverage of these areas.”
But you don’t need to do that.

**Area of interest**: Unfortunately broad. My primary interests are **philosophy of language, metaphysics and logic**. But I am also interested in **moral philosophy**.

**Course work**: 

During undergrad, my coursework was limited to political philosophy because there was no philosophy department, and the only courses related to philosophy were political philosophy taught by professors at political department. During that time, I was primarily reading historical texts like Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Rousseau, Nietzsche, etc. 

**A note on my undergrad**: In general my undergrad transcript should be completely irrelevant for my application. Let me explain. First, there are no philosophy-related coursework listed on it. (All the philosophy courses during undergrad were from auditing.) Second, I majored in Japanese during undergrad. And the GPA, esp. the first two years, isn't high. Long story short, I was painfully forced to study Japanese, which I had zero interest in. But I still get 3.87/4.0 for the last two years. That said, whether I am good at Japanese indicates anything about whether I can do well in philosophy.

Let me start with my previous work.
