## Intro

Over the past twenty years or so, many have grown tired of Quinean ontology and Carnapian metaontology (==citation==). People have found that even if we figure out what indispensably exists, we still seem to miss something important: what is more fundamental than what, and what is most fundamental. As a result, many have rallied under the banner of fundamentality. There has been a revolution in metaphysics since then.

This revolution clearly differs from Quinean ontology, but it is not immediately clear how it avoids neo-Carnapian metaontology. Neo-Carnapian deflationism basically tells us that metaphysics varies across languages. But language use is subjective and conventional. Therefore, deflationism renders metaphysical claims not *worldly and objective*. Therefore, to avoid neo-Carnapian deflationism, proponents intend fundamentality to be "*worldly and objective*" (==citations==). This is intuitive: fundamentality is a legitimate part of ordinary discourse, and we have strong intuitions that such discourse is true in virtue of what is really out there. Taking it to be worldly and objective is, therefore, prima facie plausible.

But you can't make a cake just by intending there to be one. Similarly, you cannot make fundamentality *worldly and objective* by mere intention. An argument must be made to meet the challenge. The hard part, however, is articulating the challenge: what exactly does it mean to say that something may not be *worldly and objective* at all?

This paper aims to do exactly that. I argue that current accounts of fundamentality fail to justify themselves as *objective*, and that the root of the problem is a mistaken conception of being *worldly*. I then argue that, under the right conception, we can adopt a semi-deflationary account that secures a worldly and objective notion of fundamentality.

## Struggling with Objectivity

What is "worldly and objective," really? It turns out to be hard to articulate. A first approximation could be as follows: If something is subjective, then, to a large degree, we can say whatever we feel like saying. But if it is *objective*, then there is really something *out there in the world* that restricts us from saying otherwise.

This first approximation seems intuitively right, but it cannot bear scrutiny: aren't we also part of the world? It seems that the facts about what we feel like saying are, nevertheless, also out there in the world. Indeed, Rosen (==citation==) argued that if we adopt a naturalistic conception of mind, there seems no way to articulate a sense of objectivity that is metaphysically interesting.

According to Rosen, there are two senses of objectivity: *methodological objectivity* and *metaphysical objectivity*. *Methodological objectivity* means that the inquiry itself is not vulnerable to personal bias, prejudice, etc. Rosen immediately dismisses this sense of objectivity for two reasons. *First*, it is impossible (p. 284). Any inquiry must have a substantial starting point, and there is no way to guarantee that the starting point is not biased. *Second*, it is not "the sense of objectivity that interests us" (p. 286). The interesting sense of objectivity is related to facts, not inquiries. For example, we might say it is subjective that the Mona Lisa is a beautiful painting.

*Metaphysical objectivity* means that there might be a subjective realm of the world and an objective realm of the world. For example, phenomenal states might be said to belong to a private and subjective realm. Therefore, facts about phenomenal states might be subjective in a sense. But Rosen also dismisses this sense of objectivity for being irrelevant. Even if that realm is, in a sense, subjective, the fact that *I'm in pain* seems perfectly objective in the interesting sense.

Then Rosen surveys several influential attempts to explicate the interesting sense of objectivity, including mind-independence, response-independence, and judgment-independence. But none seems to capture a metaphysically important sense of objectivity. In a nutshell, Rosen keeps returning to the same complaint: *once we have specified the fact, there seems to be no room for it to be less than objective*. A fact that involves our mental states, our responses, or our beliefs is nevertheless perfectly objective. Surely, what could it even mean to say there are "subjective facts"? Isn't that plainly self-contradictory?

In other words, according to Rosen, *methodological objectivity* is impossible and irrelevant, and *objectivity relating to facts* is trivially obtained. Rosen then concludes his paper with a puzzle: as long as we take the mind to be part of the world, it seems we cannot accuse any fact of being subjective.

But surely we can say that whether *the Mona Lisa is a beautiful painting* is subjective. What did Rosen miss? 

Returning to the Mona Lisa's beauty, where does its subjectivity comes from? Assume we stipulate that "*beautiful*" precisely means*painted by Davinci*. Then immediately the Mona Lisa is objectivity beautiful, because it is objectively being painted by Davinci. Subjectivity disappears after I stipulate the meaning of "beautiful". Where did subjectivity go? I believe it is quite clear that people will contend the following: My stipulation is totally subjective. I believe this is the right. The Mona Lisa's beauty is subjective because there are other equally good candidate meanings for "beautiful". 

In other words, "The Mona Lisa is a beautiful painting" is subjective because it does not determinately single out a fact. And the indeterminacy comes from vagueness of the meaning of "beautiful". Similarly, if one believes that utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics are all reasonable positions, then one would believe morality is not objective. To generalize the line of thought, I believe the best way to portray the interesting sense of "objectivity" is through the following:

Semantic Objectivity
: X is objective iff for there is only one reasonable meaning of 'X'

This is absolutely not a new idea. An important milestone in metaontology is Hircsh's thesis of Quantifier Variance: the meaning of the quantifier could vary, and there are equally good candidate meanings for the quantifier. Therefore, according to Quantifier Variance, the quantificational structure is not objective.

I need to stress that, even if we have a fully precisified language, it does not follow that everything is semantically objective, in the sense that is interesting to metaphysics. For example, mereological nihilists' use of their quantifier is obviously not reasonable in ordinary English. In our ordinary speech, it is clearly false to say "there are no tables". However, mereological nihilists' use of their quantifier is metaphysically reasonable. For any fact that can be expressed in ordinary language, it can also be expressed by mereological nihilists' English.[^1]





## Objectivity (~4500 words)

What I mean by objectivity is semantic variance; In this part, I first discuss some contemporary moves for trying to establish objectivity. They are all trying to establish objectivity inside their frameworks. I show that none of them can avoid semantic invariance. I argue that the only hope to avoid semantic variance is to consider the relation between the framework and us. I argue that our rational agency is a rational constraint that prevents semantic variance.

Definition of objectivity: Defining objectivity is a tricky matter. Rosen bjectivity

### Negative argument (~3000 words)

- Naturalness: Sider argues that (an extended notion of) naturalness can establish fundamentality, and reference magnetism guarantees objectivity. I argue that, reference magnetism does not exist, and naturalness could also vary.
- Essense: Fine, Schaffer, etc. argued that grounding establishes , and they think the essence of the ground grounds the grounding fact. But essence can vary. Building: Bennett argued for a rather lightweight view about fundamentality. But one of her criteria, the "generative contraint" is also framework dependent.

### Positive argument (~1500 words)

The arguments discussed in the previous section share a common pattern: we imagine a strange creature who thinks and speaks a radically different language. The challenge is that we seem unable to prove their language is metaphysically worse than ours.

A natural, initial response is to dismiss these creatures as simply _insane_. This is, in fact, the kind of response I want to defend. My strategy isn't to argue that there is something wrong with these alien languages _per se_. Instead, I want to focus on what's wrong with the relationship between _us_ and these languages.

To put it simply, *certain constraints prevents us from coherently adopting and committing to just any theory*. If these constraints have substantial metaphysical consequences, then any complete metaphysical theory we can coherently adopt must include these consequences. Moreover, these consequences will be *semantically invariant* across all theories available to us.

#### The principle of Sanity

The constraint I suggest is the following:

**The principle of sanity**
: It is impossible for us to genuinely believe oneself to not be a rational agent.

This principle also applies to acceptance (i.e. It is impossible for someone to accept oneself to not be a rational agent), but I will focus on belief in the rest of the paper. Anyway, the gist is, it is impossible for us to really adopt a theory that eliminates rational agency.

The meaning of "rational agency", of course, is highly controversial and open to multiple acceptable precisifications. Consequently, this principle will have different variants depending on how one chooses to define the term. I believe that the *principle of sanity* is plausible under most, if not all, commonsensical interpretations. In this paper, however, I will only depend on the following interpretation: *we are able to rationally control some physical objects (i.e. our bodies) at will.* 

*The principle of sanity* is more or less a stipulative axiom in this paper that I take to be self-evident. This should not be controversial, because this is already a widely accepted principle. 

Aristotle appears to adopt this principle in Chapter 9 of *De Interpretatione*. There, he rejects the principle of bivalence due to our ability to deliberate and act. He argues that, deliberation and action requires that, propositions about the future must be open (19a10). Then they cannot have a truth value now (19a26). Therefore the principle of bivalence is false. However, Aristotle's argument seems to epistemic instead of metaphysical. When he writes that "what will be has an origin both in deliberation and in action" (19a6-9), the plausible interpretation is that our *beliefs* about the future originate from these rational activities, not the future state of affairs itself. If so, his argument is best understood as follows: it is impossible for us to genuinely *believe* that the future is predetermined while simultaneously viewing ourselves as rational agents who deliberate. Therefore, by *the principle of sanity*, we cannot adopt the principle of bivalence.

There are also more contemporary cases. People seems to reject epiphenomenalism largely due to the reason that, if there's no mental causation, then it seems we wouldn't have any agency, which is insane. Therefore, in fact people have been implicitly using this principle.

There is also an auxiliary argument that targets at the Quinean methodology. Previously, I put aside the Quinean epistemology for establishing fundamentality. According to this view, the best theory of fundamentality that has the most pragmatic virtues like simplicity, elegance and explanatory power. But what how could these pragmatic virtues more valuable than our own rational agency? It seems whoever follows the Quinean methodology should adopt this principle.

#### Objective fundamentality through an interventionist account

I want to argue that *the Principle of Sanity* gives an agency-based interpretation to the interventionist approach to causation and fundamentality.

Let me give a quick introduction to this interventionism. This approach was developed by ==Pearl and Woodword== to use Structural Equation Models (SEM) to analyze causation. But this semantics has been extended to grounding in recent years, mostly by ==Schaffer grounding in the image of causation== and ==Wilson metaphysical causation==.

The most basic interventionist analysis is this: $A$ grounds $B$ if intervention on $A$'s state will change $B$'s state. The latter part can be formalized and evaluated by SEM. Let's quickly go through the basic formalization to get the gist. A SEM is $M=\{U,V,F\}$ where $U$ is a set of exogenous variables, $V$ is a set of endogenous variables, and $F$ is a set of structural equations that determines the value of endogenous variables by exogenous variables. A structural equation takes the form of $X=f(Y)$, where "$=$" does not mean equality, but means value assignment (like in programming). $X=f(Y)$ means that the value of $X$ is set to $f(Y)$. Given an assignment of exogenous variables $u$, we will have all the values in $M$ fixed. Assume $A$ is $a$ and $B$ is $b$ in the actual world. To analyze whether $A$ causes $B$, we *surgically* set the value of $A$ to $a' \neq a$  and therefore produce a new counterfactual model $M_{A=a'}$. Given the same assignment $u$, if value of $B$ in $M_{A=a'}$ is not $b$, then we say $A$ causes $B$.

Why must the intervention be "surgical"? Because we must ensure that the intervention affects only the target variable. Other variables may change as a result of intervention. But their changes should only be determined by the structural equations. The standard worry is that empirical interventions are never truly surgical. Assume we want to intervene on the current in a coil. We cannot directly create current to flow in a coil; we have to create a moving magnetic field. This in turn requires moving a magnet, and so on. And presumably this would lead to tons of variable to change. Therefore, no worldly intervention has the purity the SEM formalism presupposes, and the operation lacks an interpretation.


- Rational agency can serve as a constraint on what framework we can coherently adopt. Any framework that varies the meaning of rational agency would be inconsistent with the principle. We can use agency to interpret intervention, and use the interventionist account, developed by Schaffer and Wilson, to interpret fundamentality. This guarantees objectivity

## Worldliness (~700 words)

The previous argument may be taken as objective but not worldly. A hard core metaphysician could argue the following:

Assume P is a metaphysical proposition, then the reason to believe P must track the worldly fact that P. What I argued earlier says, the reason to believe P is the following: Believing that not P is inconsistent with our rational agency. This is not a reason that tracks the worldly fact that P. Therefore, my reason for P is not worldly.

I argue that this is not what we usually mean when we say "the world". Our metaphysical inquiry would be impossible if we strictly adopt the hard-core metaphysician's conception of worldliness. In addition, our rational agency itself is a worldly fact.

## Conclusion

I argue that the rational constraint can ensure objectivity and worldliness of our agency, but it is still compatible with deflationism about other things. And I quickly mention some other consequences that may follow from the principle of sanity.

[^1]: This claim depends on an unstructured view of facts: if two facts are equivalent, then they are the same fact. This view usually treat facts as a set of possible worlds. Could facts be more finer-grained than that? I see no compelling reason for it. It is widely known that, Russell-Myhill paradox shows that facts does not have atomic structure (i.e. $f(x) \equiv g(y) \rightarrow (f \equiv g \land x=y)$) Dorr (==citation==) argued for a position for less finer-grained structured fact by appealing to a principle called "Only Logical Circles" (i.e. $x \not\equiv_{\tau} \lambda v_{1}\dots v_{n} . y(z^{\tau},x,v_{1},\dots,v_{n})$). This view is motivated by the fact that, we cannot have circular definition. If to be blue is to be either bleen and observed before $t$, and grue otherwise, then it seems we would reject that, to be bleen is to be either blue and observed before $t$, and green otherwise.
