objective deflationism

deflationary metaphysics says that our metaphysical view are framework dependent, and thus is subjective and anti-realism. 

Recent discussion on fundamentality unwelcome deflationary view because grounding relation is intended to be worldy and objective. Deflationary view about fundamentality is automatically unwelcomed (some DN-model for grounding)

Worldly and objective deflationary account of fundamentality

Objectivity: 

definition of absolute objectivity: semantic variance

principle of sanity: semantic invariance

Worldly: 

against hard-core metaphysics; 

meta-level to object-level move
