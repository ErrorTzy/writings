Fundamentality, esp. grounding, is intended to be objective and worldly feature; Deflationism says that our metaphysical view are framework dependent. Therefore deflationism is naturally considered as a subjective and anti-realist position. This automatically disqualifies as a proper position for explicating fundamentality (though there are some DN-model for grounding).

I argue for a semi-deflationism for fundamentality by appealing to the undeflatable rational agency. I defend that this flavor of deflationism is the only way to make the project of fundamentality objective and worldly.

The raise of fundamentality:

The thesis of quantifier variance tells us there is no objective basis for privileging the meaning of "existence". Then people move on to fundamentality to seek objective structure of the reality, like what grounds what, or what is the most fundamental layer of reality. To avoid the risk of deflationism, this project is from the beginning intended to be worldly and objective. But how this could be established?

Objectivity:

What I mean by objectivity is semantic variance; In this part, I first discuss some contemporary moves for trying to establish objectivity. I show that none of them can avoid semantic invariance. Then 

reference magnets?

can the world teach us the right concept?

definition of absolute objectivity: semantic variance

principle of sanity: semantic invariance

Worldly: 

against hard-core metaphysics; 

meta-level to object-level move
