## Intro

Worldliness: our metaphysics is completely devoid the side from us. Quinean


Fundamentality, esp. grounding, is intended to be objective and worldly feature; Deflationism says that our metaphysical view are framework dependent. Therefore deflationism is naturally considered as a subjective and anti-realist position. This automatically disqualifies as a proper position for explicating fundamentality because it is not worldly.  (though there are some DN-model for grounding).

I argue for a semi-deflationism for fundamentality by appealing to the undeflatable rational agency. I defend that this flavor of deflationism is the only way to make the project of fundamentality objective and worldly.

## The raise of fundamentality (~700 words)

Quantifier variance tells us there is no objective basis for privileging the meaning of "existence". Then people give up the question of what there is and move on to fundamentality to seek objective structure of the reality, like what grounds what, or what is the most fundamental layer of reality. To avoid the risk of deflationism, this project is from the beginning intended to be objective and worldly. But how this could be established?

## Objectivity (~4500 words)

What I mean by objectivity is semantic variance; In this part, I first discuss some contemporary moves for trying to establish objectivity. They are all trying to establish objectivity inside their frameworks. I show that none of them can avoid semantic invariance. I argue that the only hope to avoid semantic variance is to consider the relation between the framework and us. I argue that our rational agency is a rational constraint that prevents semantic variance.

Definition of objectivity: Defining objectivity is a tricky matter. Rosen bjectivity

### Negative argument (~3000 words)

- Naturalness: Sider argues that (an extended notion of) naturalness can establish fundamentality, and reference magnetism guarantees objectivity. I argue that, reference magnetism does not exist, and naturalness could also vary.
- Essense: Fine, Schaffer, etc. argued that grounding establishes , and they think the essence of the ground grounds the grounding fact. But essence can vary. Building: Bennett argued for a rather lightweight view about fundamentality. But one of her criteria, the "generative contraint" is also framework dependent.

### Positive argument (~1500 words)

The arguments discussed in the previous section share a common pattern: we imagine a strange creature who thinks and speaks a radically different language. The challenge is that we seem unable to prove their language is metaphysically worse than ours.

A natural, initial response is to dismiss these creatures as simply _insane_. This is, in fact, the kind of response I want to defend. My strategy isn't to argue that there is something wrong with these alien languages _per se_. Instead, I want to focus on what's wrong with the relationship between _us_ and these languages.

To put it simply, *certain constraints prevents us from coherently adopting and committing to just any theory*. If these constraints have substantial metaphysical consequences, then any complete metaphysical theory we can coherently adopt must include these consequences. Moreover, these consequences will be *semantically invariant* across all theories available to us.

#### The principle of Sanity

The constraint I suggest is the following:

**The principle of sanity**
: It is impossible for us to genuinely believe oneself to not be a rational agent.

This principle also applies to acceptance (i.e. It is impossible for someone to accept oneself to not be a rational agent), but I will focus on belief in the rest of the paper. Anyway, the gist is, it is impossible for us to really adopt a theory that eliminates rational agency.

The meaning of "rational agency", of course, is highly controversial and open to multiple acceptable precisifications. Consequently, this principle will have different variants depending on how one chooses to define the term. I believe that the *principle of sanity* is plausible under most, if not all, commonsensical interpretations. In this paper, however, I will only depend on the following interpretation: *we are able to rationally control some physical objects (i.e. our bodies) at will.* 

*The principle of sanity* is more or less a stipulative axiom in this paper that I take to be self-evident. This should not be controversial, because this is already a widely accepted principle. 

Aristotle appears to adopt this principle in Chapter 9 of *De Interpretatione*. There, he rejects the principle of bivalence due to our ability to deliberate and act. He argues that, deliberation and action requires that, propositions about the future must be open (19a10). Then they cannot have a truth value now (19a26). Therefore the principle of bivalence is false. However, Aristotle's argument seems to epistemic instead of metaphysical. When he writes that "what will be has an origin both in deliberation and in action" (19a6-9), the plausible interpretation is that our *beliefs* about the future originate from these rational activities, not the future state of affairs itself. If so, his argument is best understood as follows: it is impossible for us to genuinely *believe* that the future is predetermined while simultaneously viewing ourselves as rational agents who deliberate. Therefore, by *the principle of sanity*, we cannot adopt the principle of bivalence.

There are also more contemporary cases. People seems to reject epiphenomenalism largely due to the reason that, if there's no mental causation, then it seems we wouldn't have any agency, which is insane. Therefore, in fact people have been implicitly using this principle.

There is also an auxiliary argument that targets at the Quinean methodology. Previously, I put aside the Quinean epistemology for establishing fundamentality. According to this view, the best theory of fundamentality that has the most pragmatic virtues like simplicity, elegance and explanatory power. But what how could these pragmatic virtues more valuable than our own rational agency? It seems whoever follows the Quinean methodology should adopt this principle.

#### Objective fundamentality through an interventionist account

I want to argue that *the Principle of Sanity* gives an agency-based interpretation to the interventionist approach to causation and fundamentality.

Let me give a quick introduction to this interventionism. This approach was developed by ==Pearl and Woodword== to use Structural Equation Models (SEM) to analyze causation. But this semantics has been extended to grounding in recent years, mostly by ==Schaffer grounding in the image of causation== and ==Wilson metaphysical causation==.

The most basic interventionist analysis is this: $A$ grounds $B$ if intervention on $A$'s state will change $B$'s state. The latter part can be formalized and evaluated by SEM. Let's quickly go through the basic formalization to get the gist. A SEM is $M=\{U,V,F\}$ where $U$ is a set of exogenous variables, $V$ is a set of endogenous variables, and $F$ is a set of structural equations that determines the value of endogenous variables by exogenous variables. A structural equation takes the form of $X=f(Y)$, where "$=$" does not mean equality, but means value assignment (like in programming). $X=f(Y)$ means that the value of $X$ is set to $f(Y)$. Given an assignment of exogenous variables $u$, we will have all the values in $M$ fixed. Assume $A$ is $a$ and $B$ is $b$ in the actual world. To analyze whether $A$ causes $B$, we *surgically* set the value of $A$ to $a' \neq a$  and therefore produce a new counterfactual model $M_{A=a'}$. Given the same assignment $u$, if value of $B$ in $M_{A=a'}$ is not $b$, then we say $A$ causes $B$.

Why must the intervention be "surgical"? Because we must ensure that the intervention affects only the target variable. Other variables may change as a result of intervention. But their changes should only be determined by the structural equations. The standard worry is that empirical interventions are never truly surgical. Assume we want to intervene on the current in a coil. We cannot directly create current to flow in a coil; we have to create a moving magnetic field. This in turn requires moving a magnet, and so on. And presumably this would lead to tons of variable to change. Therefore, no worldly intervention has the purity the SEM formalism presupposes, and the operation lacks an interpretation.


- Rational agency can serve as a constraint on what framework we can coherently adopt. Any framework that varies the meaning of rational agency would be inconsistent with the principle. We can use agency to interpret intervention, and use the interventionist account, developed by Schaffer and Wilson, to interpret fundamentality. This guarantees objectivity

## Worldliness (~700 words)

The previous argument may be taken as objective but not worldly. A hard core metaphysician could argue the following:

Assume P is a metaphysical proposition, then the reason to believe P must track the worldly fact that P. What I argued earlier says, the reason to believe P is the following: Believing that not P is inconsistent with our rational agency. This is not a reason that tracks the worldly fact that P. Therefore, my reason for P is not worldly.

I argue that this is not what we usually mean when we say "the world". Our metaphysical inquiry would be impossible if we strictly adopt the hard-core metaphysician's conception of worldliness. In addition, our rational agency itself is a worldly fact.

## Conclusion

I argue that the rational constraint can ensure objectivity and worldliness of our agency, but it is still compatible with deflationism about other things. And I quickly mention some other consequences that may follow from the principle of sanity.
