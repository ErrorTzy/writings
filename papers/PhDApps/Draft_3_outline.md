Fundamentality, esp. grounding, is intended to be objective and worldly feature; Deflationism says that our metaphysical view are framework dependent. Therefore deflationism is naturally considered as subjective and anti-realist position. This automatically disqualifies as a proper position for explicating fundamentality (though there are some DN-model for grounding).

I defend a restrcited account of deflationism by appealing to the undoubtablility of our rational agency. I defend that this flavor of deflationism is both objective and worldly.

Worldly and objective deflationary account of fundamentality

Objectivity: 

definition of absolute objectivity: semantic variance

principle of sanity: semantic invariance

Worldly: 

against hard-core metaphysics; 

meta-level to object-level move
