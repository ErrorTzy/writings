## Intro

Fundamentality, esp. grounding, is intended to be objective and worldly feature; Deflationism says that our metaphysical view are framework dependent. Therefore deflationism is naturally considered as a subjective and anti-realist position. This automatically disqualifies as a proper position for explicating fundamentality (though there are some DN-model for grounding).

I argue for a semi-deflationism for fundamentality by appealing to the undeflatable rational agency. I defend that this flavor of deflationism is the only way to make the project of fundamentality objective and worldly.

## The raise of fundamentality (~700 words)

Quantifier variance tells us there is no objective basis for privileging the meaning of "existence". Then people give up the question of what there is and move on to fundamentality to seek objective structure of the reality, like what grounds what, or what is the most fundamental layer of reality. To avoid the risk of deflationism, this project is from the beginning intended to be objective and worldly. But how this could be established?

## Objectivity (~4500 words)

What I mean by objectivity is semantic variance; In this part, I first discuss some contemporary moves for trying to establish objectivity. They are all trying to establish objectivity inside their frameworks. I show that none of them can avoid semantic invariance. I argue that the only hope to avoid semantic variance is to consider the relation between the framework and us. I argue that our rational agency is a rational constraint that prevents semantic variance.

### Negative argument (~3000 words)

- Naturalness: Sider argues that (an extended notion of) naturalness can establish fundamentality, and reference magnetism guarantees objectivity. I argue that, reference magnetism does not exist, and naturalness could also vary.
- Essense: Fine, Schaffer, etc. argued that grounding establishes , and they think the essence of the ground grounds the grounding fact. But essence can vary.
- Building: Bennett argued for a rather lightweight view about fundamentality. But one of her criteria, the "generative contraint" is also framework dependent.

### Positive argument (~1500 words)

The arguments discussed in the previous section share a common pattern: we imagine a strange creature who thinks and speaks a radically different language. The challenge is that we seem unable to prove their language is metaphysically worse than ours.

A natural, initial response is to dismiss these creatures as simply _insane_. This is, in fact, the kind of response I want to defend. My strategy isn't to argue that there is something wrong with these alien languages _per se_. Instead, I want to focus on what's wrong with the relationship between _us_ and these languages.

To put it simply, *certain constraints prevents us from coherently adopting and committing to just any theory*. If these constraints have substantial metaphysical consequences, then any complete metaphysical theory we can coherently adopt must include these consequences. Moreover, these consequences will be *semantically invariant* across all theories available to us.

- Rational agency can serve as a constraint on what framework we can coherently adopt. Any framework that varies the meaning of rational agency would be inconsistent with the principle. We can use agency to interpret intervention, and use the interventionist account, developed by Schaffer and Wilson, to interpret fundamentality. This guarantees objectivity

## Worldliness (~700 words)

The previous argument may be taken as objective but not worldly. A hard core metaphysician could argue the following:

Assume P is a metaphysical proposition, then the reason to believe P must track the worldly fact that P. What I argued earlier says, the reason to believe P is the following: Believing that not P is inconsistent with our rational agency. This is not a reason that tracks the worldly fact that P. Therefore, my reason for P is not worldly.

I argue that this is not what we usually mean when we say "the world". Our metaphysical inquiry would be impossible if we strictly adopt the hard-core metaphysician's conception of worldliness. In addition, our rational agency itself is a worldly fact.

## Conclusion

I argue that the rational constraint can ensure objectivity and worldliness of our agency, but it is still compatible with deflationism about other things. And I quickly mention some other consequences that may follow from the principle of sanity.
