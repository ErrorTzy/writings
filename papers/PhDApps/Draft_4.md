A metaphysical approach to the epistemic approach to ground
## Intro

Over the past twenty years or so, many have grown tired of Quinean ontology and Carnapian deflationism (==citation==). People have found that even if we figure out what indispensably exists, we still seem to miss something important: what is more fundamental than what, and what is most fundamental. As a result, many have rallied under the banner of fundamentality. Since then, metaphysics has undergone a revolution.

The orthodox way to analyze fundamentality is through the so-called "grounding relation." Roughly: if $X$ grounds $Y$, then $X$ is more fundamental than $Y$; and if $X$ is ungrounded, then $X$ is absolutely fundamental. There are ordinary intelligible locutions that reveal this kind of relation: there is a table *because* there are particles arranged tablewise; Singleton Socrates exists *in virtue of* Socrates' existence. And isn't it obvious that, these locutions are *objectively* true? Thus, there is a strong intuition that the grounding facts are something out there in the world, not merely a conceptual matter.

This intuition is compelling, but can it bear scrutiny? Hall (==An Epistemic Approach to Ground==) argues for an epistemic approach to ground. According to Hall, the motivating locutions, like "in virtue of," are grounding explanations. But it does not follow that grounding itself is metaphysical. The alternative is to take the nature of grounding as "purely a topic in epistemology," because the grounding relation does not "mark out any distinctive kind of metaphysical structure."

Is the epistemic approach the *right* approach? Hall says, "I don't know." This paper aims to find out. I argue that, no resource in current grounding literature can respond to Hall's challenge. We must accept the epistemic approach to ground. But it does not follow that grounding relation cannot be a distinctive kind of metaphysical structure.

## The epistemic approach to ground

What is the epistemic approach to ground? As I said in the intro, there is a special kind of non-causal explanation: there is a table *because* there are particles arranged tablewise; Singleton Socrates exists *in virtue of* Socrates' existence. It is out of this kind of locution that motivates people to posit metaphysical grounding relation.

But explanations are (in)famously sensitive to context, like our interests, background knowledge, and so on. Suppose someone is investigating why a forest fire occurred. In that context, answering "Because oxygen is present in the atmosphere" would be inappropriate. In a chemistry class, however, the same question, "Why was there a forest fire?", might be aptly answered by "Because oxygen is present in the atmosphere." In short, whether something counts as an explanation can depend on contingent features like our epistemic interest and human psychology.

The metaphysical approach to grounding explanations makes a critical claim:

{::M} Grounding explanations are explanatory in virtue of the deep structure of reality.

This is the move Hall targets. Why think grounding explanations are explanatory because of some deep structure of reality? Perhaps they are explanatory because of something else, like our epistemic or psychological features. Hall's alternative proposal is:

{::E} Grounding explanations are explanatory in virtue of our epistemic and psychological features.

Why does Hall argue against {::M}? First, he reconstructs the motivation for {::M}. Then he undermines that motivation.

The motivation for {::M} draws on Lewis's distinction between an *explanatory act* and *explanatory information*. An explanation can be inappropriate in a given context while still conveying explanatory information. In the forest-fire case, it is at least plausible that the presence of atmospheric oxygen is a piece of relevant explanatory *information*. The *act* of offering that information, however, may be inappropriate in some contexts.

On the basis of this distinction, Lewis proposes a "metaphysical ascent." On his view, whether an *act of explaining* is well performed depends on epistemic and psychological factors. By contrast, whether something counts as *explanatory information* is independent of those factors and is a matter of metaphysics. More specifically, Lewis holds that explanatory information about an event concerns the causal structure that produces it: the causes, the causes of those causes, and so on.

This ascent can be extended to the metaphysical approach to grounding. Essentially, Lewis suggests that a genuine explanation of $x$ is backed by a structure underlying $x$; and that structure need not be limited to causal structure. It is natural, then, to bring grounding structure into the picture. The resulting line of thought is:

{::1} A grounding explanation is explanatory because it conveys information about grounding structure.
{::2} The information about grounding structure reveals some deep metaphysical structure of reality.

From {::1} and {::2}, {::M} follows. 

Hall wants to undermine {::2}. In other words, Hall acknowledges the distinction between explanatory acts and explanatory information. But he rejects Lewis's "metaphysical ascent", because the act/information distinction does not entail that explanatory information must be something metaphysical. On Hall's view, what makes some chunk of information explanatory could still be epistemic and psychological, without appealing to metaphysics.

Why say this? Because it is obvious that, there's a tight connection between explanation and understanding. But whether we understand something surely depend on our epistemology and psychology. Lewis' view needs to maintain this tight connection, while argue that some information can be explanatory purely out of metaphysical reasons. How?

Lewis' reply is that, to understand something is just to possess enough explanatory information. ==Lewis 1986, 28== However, this seems wrong. On Lewis's picture, the first billion years of the causal history leading to the window's breaking would count as a huge body of explanatory information. If understanding were simply possessing enough explanatory information, and if explanatory information is just about metaphysical structure, then learning about that first billion-year history should greatly improve our understanding of why the window broke. It plainly does not. Therefore, as Hall argues, the more plausible approach is to say that what makes some information explanatory is whether it improves our understanding, not that we understand by merely possessing explanatory information. Given that what counts as explanatory depends on whether it produces understanding, then Hall's view opens up the possiblity to reject {::2}: information about grounding structure may track the order of our *understanding*, not the order of reality.

But this line of reasoning merely opens an alternative to {::2}; it does not show {::2} to be false. Epistemic and psychological features can influence whether a chunk of information is explanatory. It does not follow that they are the only source of explanatory status; metaphysical facts may still matter. Hall offers an arguments against this possibility.

The argument runs as follows. In our mathematics, we distinguish axioms from theorems, lemmas and corollaries. Theorems are proven from axioms, and lemmas and corollaries are proven from theorems. For example, strong induction is a theorem that can be proven from the Peano axioms (PA). We may say the PA explain why strong induction is true, and that the PA are more basic than strong induction. However, Hall invites us to imagine two different kinds of Alien Arithmeticians (AAs).

The first kind of AAs has mathematics very similar to ours, but adopts a completely different set of axioms. Thus, they have a very different conception of which propositions are fundamental and which are derived. The second kind of AAs, by contrast, takes the Peano axioms as its preferred axioms, but cannot understand why we distinguish theorems, lemmas, and corollaries. For them, every result is treated as a direct consequence of the axioms, and they cannot make sense of our talk about some proofs being more elegant than others. Consequently, their conception of mathematical structure has only two layers: a fundamental layer of axioms and a second layer containing everything else.

What these two kinds of AAs are supposed to show is best understood as follows. There seems to be no flaw in the AAs' mathematics. We agree with them on the truth value of every mathematical proposition, yet they impose an alternative structure on mathematics. Are they making some metaphysical mistake nevertheless? There seems no reason to say so. According to Hall, our conception of the rich structure of axioms, theorems, lemmas, and corollaries should not be taken as a matter of metaphysics. Instead, it should be taken as the structure of our understanding, not the structure of reality. Given this motivation, Hall generalizes it into the following claim:

> A grounding claim counts as explanatory not in virtue of the fact that it provides information about a special kind of metaphysical structure, but in virtue of the kind of epistemic benefit it confers on its recipients. ==Hall 2023, p. 252==

In other words, on Hall's view, to say that $x$ grounds $y$ is (roughly) to say that $x$ gives us more epistemic benefit than $y$. For example, $x$ may "enhance our ability to conduct inquiry into what necessitates what". Hence, Hall motivates {::E} as an alternative epistemic approach to grounding.

### The Problem with Hall's argument

However, there are some critical issues with Hall's argument. First, what does "epistemic benefit" or "enhances our ability to conduct inquiry" mean, exactly? In Sections 5, Hall seems to treat this to mean "exceedingly obvious". But that is precisely what grounding claims are not about. The project of grounding is often seen as a revival of Aristotle's metaphysics. So let's go back to Aristotle:

> The natural way of doing this is to start from the things which are more knowable and obvious to us and proceed towards those which are clearer and more knowable by nature; for the same things are not 'knowable relatively to us' and 'knowable' without qualification. So in the present inquiry we must follow this method and advance from what is more obscure by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable by nature. (Physics I, 184a17–23)

What Aristotle means by "clear by nature" is far from clear. Still, on his view, what is more fundamental may be less clear to us. For example, it is intuitive to say that, particles arranged tablewise are more fundamental than a table. Yet for us, a table is a much clearer concept than a particle. We know what a table typically looks like and what we can do with a table. Most people know very little about particles, and we never reason in terms of particles. Even for someone who has spent years studying particle physics, we still seem bewildered by certain features of particles: are they just waves? do they exist in a probabilistic state? and so on. We are not bewildered by a table (perhaps aside from the occasional piece in a modern art museum). So it seems false to say, particles arranged tablewise give us more epistemic benefit than tables.

Second, I believe Hall's argument from AA's alternative mathematical structure is on the right track. But the move from AA to a generalized claim about grounding is too quick. If the argument from AA holds, then it shows that information about *mathematical* structure may not reveal some deep metaphysical structure of reality. It does not follow that, reality has no metaphysical structure at all. 

Eventually, I will explicate what "epistemic benefit" should mean. By doing so, I show that {::E} is right, but {::M} is compatible with it. But for now, let's turn to the second problem. Hall's argument surely carries weight, but it seems that Hall over-generalized his conclusion. The first thing we need to sort out is to what extent does Hall's argument apply.
### Rethinking Hall's argument

Hall's position: there is nothing beyond necessary relation. There is no grounding structure beyond necessary connection. ==why?==
It is true that an iconic feature for grounding to be hyperintensional and "post-modal". But there are still some grounding relation that can be captured by modality.

Here I need to clarify what I mean by grounding. In Hall's discussion, grounding simply is just *the* relation to analyze fundamentality. But this is not incontrosversial. Sometimes, what is called "grounding relation" is just a narrow, specific relation whose relata are *facts*. To avoid confusion, let's call this narrow conception*factive grounding*. But we may say some *object*, like Socrates is more fundamental than singleton Socrates. Therefore, fundamentality relation may as well be other relations than factive grounding. Maybe these relations can be analyzed by factive grounding, and thus factive grounding is the most fundamental fundamentality relation. But the point is, there are relations other than factive grounding that is relevant to fundamentality. Therefore, it is better to treat what Hall means (and what I mean here) by "grounding" is a more general term for fundamentality. 

This broader concept of "grounding" here is Wilson's talk of "small-'g' grounding relations" (==Wilson 2014==), or what Bennett calls "building" (==making things up==). Following Bennett, under this conception, to say a relation is a grounding relation is to say it is a member in a set of relations that are *asymmetric* and*necessitating*.[^3] Some examples are composition, constitution, set-formation, (property) realization, causation, and maybe factive grounding. The point is, not all grounding relation are hyperintensional and "post-modal". Roughly, if $Rxy$ makes $\square (x \leftrightarrow y)$ true, then let's call the relation $R$ *mutually necessitating*.[^1] And it seems Hall is only skeptical about the grounding relations that are mutually necessitating. This is natural, because Hall draw his argument from mathematical explanation, and all mathematical truth are mutually necessitating.

Hall's argument can be generalized. In essence, Hall is saying that, given any mutually necessitating relation, we can always imagine many alternative structure specified by an alternative grounding relation. Say a binary asymmetric relation $R\subseteq D\times D$ is mutually necessitating. Then we can define inverse $R^{-1}=\{(x,y)\in D\times D \mid R(y,x)\}$. Given that $R^{-1}(x,y) \leftrightarrow R(y,x)$, it is easy to see $R^{-1}$ is also asymmetric and necessitating. Moreover, let $x\equiv_{\Box}y$ abbreviate $\Box(x\leftrightarrow y)$. $R$ lies inside the union of $\equiv_{\Box}$-classes, i.e. $R\subseteq\bigcup_{C\in D/\!\equiv_{\Box}}(C\times C)$. Hence within each $\equiv_{\Box}$-class $C$ of size $n$ one may independently pick for every unordered pair $\{u,v\}\subset C$ either $u\to v$, $v\to u$, or neither, producing $3^{\binom{n}{2}}$ asymmetric, necessitating relations on $C$. Whenever some $\equiv_{\Box}$-class has $n\ge 2$ there are therefore combinatorially many relations $R^{*}$ that (i) predicate over the same domain, (ii) are necessitating and directed, yet (iii) are extensionally different from a given directed, necessitating $R$.

But Hall's argument cannot be extended to those grounding relations that are not mutually necessitating. Consider the previous example: particles arranged table-wise composes, and thus ground, the table[^2]. As long as we do not adopt mereological essentialism, then material composition is not mutually necessitating: The parts necessitate the whole, but the whole does not necessitate those specific parts. In other words, if $a_{1},\dots,a_{n}$ arranging in a certain way $W$ composes $b$, then the only necessary sentences we can draw from it is $\square (W(a_{1},\dots,a_{n}) \rightarrow E(b))$. Could there there be a way to say, $a_{1},\dots,a_{n-1},b$ arranging in a certain way $W'$ *composes\** $a_{n}$? There are technical issues about how to specify the constraint for $W'$, for if $W' \equiv \lambda x_{1}\dots x_{n-1}. E(a_{n})$ then we can draw $\square (W(a_{1},\dots,a_{n-1},b) \rightarrow E(a_{n}))$. For example, we may need to stipulate that no constraint occurs in $W$. But let's not go into the technical weeds here and go back to plain English argument. It seems obvious that, no matter what relation between the left part of this particular table and this particular table, it does not necessitate this particular right part of this table. In other words, *compose\** cannot be a necessitating relation. Therefore, *compose\** cannot be a grounding relation. Only "compose" can. There is no alternative structure that can be adopted.[^4]

we should not interpret the aliens mean compose by "*compose\**". 

Let me explain the

But some grounding relation can 



's position: What can mark out anything distinctively metaphysical at all? Notice that, the official ontology that the grounding theorist adopt is easy ontology: everything that we can talk about, including abstract entities or fictional objects, trivially exists==Schaffer citation; and footnote on easy ontology==. Therefore, even if grounding is epistemic, it would be true to say that grounding relation exists. To say grounding isn't "distinctively metaphysical" seems to 


What does it really mean to say, something does not "mark out any distinctive kind of metaphysical structure" at all? 

[^1]: This formulation is formally problematic when $x$ and $y$ are not sentences. But there are multiple obvious ways to patch this. For example, if $x$ and $y$ are entities, then we can say $\square (E(x) \leftrightarrow E(y))$. If $x$ and $y$ are predicates, then we can say $\forall \alpha (x(\alpha) \leftrightarrow y(\alpha))$.
[^2]: According to Schaffer's priority monism (==citation==), $x$ composes $y$ does not follow that $x$ grounds $y$. But let's leave this view aside for now. We can adopt Bennett's strategy to say, there are difference sense of grounding (or in Bennett's terminology, "building"). What I am talking about here, is $x\text{ grounds}_{compose} \text{ }y$, not $x\text{ grounds}_{\text{factively ground}} \text{ }y$. Therefore, Schaffer's argument is not relevant here.
[^3]: In fact, Bennett's criterion is asymmetric, necessitating and*generative*. However, generative seems to be a vacuous condition. According to Bennett, the generative requirement is that, "if a builds\[grounds\] b, then b exists (obtains, is instantiated . . . ) because a does, b exists (obtains, is instantiated) in virtue of a, a makes b exist (obtain, be instantiated), and so forth."==citation==. But this is directly under Hall's attack: whether b obtains in virtue of a is a matter of explanation, and explanation is a matter of understanding. In fact, Bennett herself admit that what counts generative may be arbitrary, conventional, framework-dependent and "nothing further to be said" (==p. 59==). Therefore, for any asymmetric and necessitating relation, we can always imagine an alien creature that think it is generative. Therefore, if we want to be a robust realist about fundamentality, being generative cannot be the right way to fix grounding relation.
[^4]: One move is to say, some alien could say "*compose\**" is a "grounding relation" because it *necessitates\**. But we are talking about grounding and fundamentality, not "*grounding\**" or "*fundamentality\**". A grounding relation must be necessitating, not *necessitating\**. This line of reply is not yet fully justified yet. You may ask, why a grounding relation must be necessitating, not *necessitating\**? The answer will be clearer near the end of the paper.
