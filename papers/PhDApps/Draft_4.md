A metaphysical approach to the epistemic approach to ground
## Intro

Over the past twenty years or so, many have grown tired of Quinean ontology and Carnapian deflationism (==citation==). People have found that even if we figure out what indispensably exists, we still seem to miss something important: what is more fundamental than what, and what is most fundamental. As a result, many have rallied under the banner of fundamentality. Since then, metaphysics has undergone a revolution.

The orthodox way to analyze fundamentality is through the so-called "grounding relation." Roughly: if $X$ grounds $Y$, then $X$ is more fundamental than $Y$; and if $X$ is ungrounded, then $X$ is absolutely fundamental. There are ordinary intelligible locutions that reveal this kind of relation: there is a table *because* there are particles arranged tablewise; Singleton Socrates exists *in virtue of* Socrates' existence. And isn't it obvious that, these locutions are *objectively* true? Thus, there is a strong intuition that the grounding facts are something out there in the world, not merely a conceptual matter.

This intuition is compelling, but can it bear scrutiny? Hall (==An Epistemic Approach to Ground==) argues for an epistemic approach to ground. According to Hall, the motivating locutions, like "in virtue of," are grounding explanations. But it does not follow that grounding itself is metaphysical. The alternative is to take the nature of grounding as "purely a topic in epistemology," because the grounding relation does not "mark out any distinctive kind of metaphysical structure."

Is the epistemic approach the *right* approach? Hall says, "I don't know." This paper aims to find out. I argue that, no resource in current grounding literature can respond to Hall's challenge. We must accept the epistemic approach to ground. But it does not follow that grounding relation cannot be a distinctive kind of metaphysical structure.

## The epistemic approach to ground



to ground. But the hard-core conception is wrong.



's position: What can mark out anything distinctively metaphysical at all? Notice that, the official ontology that the grounding theorist adopt is easy ontology: everything that we can talk about, including abstract entities or fictional objects, trivially exists==Schaffer citation; and footnote on easy ontology==. Therefore, even if grounding is epistemic, it would be true to say that grounding relation exists. To say grounding isn't "distinctively metaphysical" seems to 


What does it really mean to say, something does not "mark out any distinctive kind of metaphysical structure" at all?
