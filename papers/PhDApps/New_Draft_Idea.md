What is semantics? We have linguistic behaviors. These behaviors encode our thoughts; And we decode other people's thought by interpreting other people's behabvior of uttering words in a context. 

Starting intuition: out of all entities we talk about, we privilige some instead of others. For example, we say tables, chairs, rocks and cats are really something out there; But though we talk about promises, holes, prime numbers and shadows, we do not think they "really exist", or at least not "as real as" tables and chairs. What does this "real" here mean is a great great mystery. 

Why we make this distinction at all?

Is there a difference between these "not really exist" things and "really not exist" things, like unicorns? Surely, holes and promises are things that do exist in some sense. So their ontological status is, once again, special. Now it seems we say there are things that "heavily exist", "thinly exist" and "does not exist".

Now the task is to explain, why we think there are so many "ways of existence". Is there anything deep to it? Or is it just a psychological matter?

What should philosophy do? There are something that comes at the first glance. For example, at my first glance, there is a table. And maybe by reflection, I realize what I have is an experience of seeing a table. This could be an illusion, or a dream. But as long as it isn't, an explanation for having this experience is that, there is a table out there that causes the experience. The first-glance thought might be something called "intuition". This carries our actual ontological commitment. But it says nothing about whether we are justified, or rational in commiting to them ontologically. What makes this intuition rational or justified, it seems, it that, it *explains* why we have sensory experiences. Therefore, it's not only we have the ontological commitment of a table by default, but also we have a reason for it: it explains why we have those sensory experiences. But it's not enough for us to have a reason for us. In order to justify our commitment, it seems we need a *good* reason. It seems obviously not rational to say, we think earth is flat for the reason that pigs can't actually fly. But what if I really formed the belief that earth is flat due to the reason that pigs can't actually fly? Normally we would say these two facts are not relavant. But why these two facts are not relavant, but there being a table in front of me is relavant to me having such and such perceptual experience? 

Then now the question is, what exactly do we mean when we say "there being a table explains I saw a table", and why this count as a good reason for "there being a table" to be true. 

### 1. Starting intuition: “concrete existence” feels privileged

1.1. In ordinary thinking, we distinguish between **concrete things** (tables, chairs, rocks, cats) and **non-concrete things** (promises, holes, prime numbers, shadows).

1.2. We’re happy, in everyday language, to say that there _are_ promises, holes, prime numbers, and shadows. But we also have an inclination to say that they don’t exist in quite the same way that tables and chairs exist.

1.3. This often gets expressed as a sense that only concrete objects **“really” exist**, or have a privileged, fully robust form of existence. Everything else exists in some thinner, derivative, or merely conceptual way.

1.4. So there seems to be a **metaphysical value** attached to concreteness: when we do serious ontology, we feel pressure to treat the concrete as the primary or “real” part of what there is.

---

### 2. The “concrete” / “non-concrete” line becomes blurry

2.1. The more we look at modern physics, the stranger “concreteness” becomes.

2.2. Consider **quantum entities** (electrons, quarks, quantum fields) and **electromagnetic fields**. Are these “concrete” in the same sense as tables and chairs? They don’t look or behave like solid, medium-sized objects at all.

2.3. Even familiar objects like atoms are strange: most of the volume of an atom is “empty space” in some sense. Yet tables and chairs are built from atoms.

2.4. So if concreteness is tied to intuitive ideas like “solid stuff in space,” then the things we regard as paradigmatically concrete (tables and chairs) are made out of things that don’t fit that intuitive picture.

2.5. This suggests that **“concrete” is not a stable or well-defined ontological category**. It works well at the level of common sense, but under scientific scrutiny it becomes unclear where exactly to draw the boundary.

2.6. Therefore, any ontological program that says “only concrete things really exist” is threatened by the fact that the notion of concreteness itself becomes problematic in light of our best theories.

---

### 3. Dropping the “only concrete exists” constraint doesn’t solve things

3.1. Suppose we give up the restriction that we should only be ontologically committed to concrete entities. Then we allow that abstract or non-concrete entities might also be part of what there is.

3.2. Once we do this, a new problem appears: **what, exactly, should we commit to**?

3.3. One extreme view would be: commit to _everything_ that we can talk about—promises, holes, numbers, shadows, fictional characters, etc.

3.4. But that seems wrong: we **do want a distinction** between:

- entities that are “really” there (electrons, people, trees, maybe numbers), and
    
- entities that are purely fictional or merely imaginary (Sherlock Holmes, unicorns, etc.).
    

3.5. If we treat all referents of our discourse as equally real, we lose this important **real/fictional** (or real/merely-imagined) distinction. That seems unacceptable for an adequate ontology.

3.6. So even when we stop privileging concreteness, we still face the problem: how do we draw principled lines in our ontology? Which entities earn serious ontological commitment, and which don’t?

---

### 4. Attempted solution: privilege the “fundamental”

4.1. A natural response is: maybe we should give **ontological priority** to whatever is **most fundamental**.

4.2. On this picture, there may be many real things—tables, chairs, promises, numbers—but some things are **more basic** than others. The rest depend on, or are grounded in, those fundamental entities.

4.3. Then we might say: our deepest ontological commitment should be to the fundamental level; everything else is derivative, or perhaps even dispensable.

4.4. However, there is deep disagreement over **what counts as fundamental**:

- A **physicalist** might say: the fundamental entities are physical particles, fields, spacetime, or whatever physics ultimately says exists. Tables and chairs are constructed out of those; abstracta are mere abstractions from the concrete physical realm.
    
- A **Platonist** (in a strong sense) might say: the fundamental entities are Platonic Forms or abstract structures. The physical world is derivative, a kind of shadow or imperfect realization of these Forms.
    

4.5. On the Platonist picture, tables and chairs may end up looking “less real” or “illusory” relative to the Forms, just as on physicalism numbers or Forms might be treated as mere conceptual entities derived from physical processes.

4.6. The key point: **each side can claim fundamentality for its preferred entities** and demote or “deflate” the other’s favorite entities as illusory, derivative, or mere appearances.

4.7. Thus, appeal to fundamentality **by itself** does not settle the ontological question; without an independent way to decide what is fundamental, the notion of fundamentality risks just re-labeling our prior biases.

---

### 5. Another attempt: follow common sense ontology

5.1. Another possible strategy: perhaps our ontological commitments should largely align with **common sense**.

5.2. In everyday life, people straightforwardly commit to:

- tables, chairs, cats, persons,  
    and they do **not** commit to:
    
- high-dimensional manifolds, quantum wavefunctions, and other theoretical exotica.
    

5.3. So one might think: our ontology should treat as “real” roughly the things that ordinary thought and language treats as real.

5.4. This would make middle-sized objects, persons, and so on central, and would be suspicious of entities that are only posited by sophisticated scientific or mathematical theories.

5.5. But here a normative problem arises. The fact that we _do_ commit, in practice, to tables and chairs doesn’t by itself entail that we _ought to_ commit to them in our best metaphysical theory.

5.6. This mirrors the familiar **is–ought gap**: from a description of what we _in fact do_ (our ordinary ontological assumptions), it does not straightforwardly follow what we _should_ believe about reality.

5.7. So an appeal to common sense seems, at best, to give us data about our current conceptual scheme, not a justification for what the correct ontology must be.

---

### 6. The resulting puzzle

6.1. We began with an intuitive distinction between **concrete** and **non-concrete** entities and a corresponding feeling that only the concrete “really” exist.

6.2. But closer examination shows that **concreteness is unstable** as a metaphysical category, especially once we consider contemporary physics and the structure of matter.

6.3. Dropping the insistence on concreteness leaves us with a new problem: how to avoid **ontological inflation**, where we treat everything we can talk about (including fictional characters) as equally real.

6.4. A natural move is to say: we should primarily commit to what is **fundamental**, with other entities being derivative. But competing metaphysical pictures disagree radically on what is fundamental (physical vs abstract, matter vs Forms), and we lack a neutral criterion that picks out the correct notion of fundamentality.

6.5. Turning instead to **common sense** looks tempting, but that seems to confuse our actual, historically contingent patterns of belief with what we _ought_ to believe about reality. The mere fact that ordinary people believe in tables but not manifolds doesn’t resolve the metaphysical question.

6.6. So we arrive at a genuine **problem about ontological commitment**:

- Concreteness won’t cleanly sort the real from the unreal.
    
- Fundamentality is itself up for grabs and can be claimed by radically different theories.
    
- Common sense doesn’t seem to give us a normatively authoritative guide.
    

6.7. Hence the core question emerges: **What principle or method—if any—can tell us what we should be ontologically committed to, and how to justify that commitment, without relying on shaky notions like concreteness, ungrounded claims about fundamentality, or an uncritical appeal to common sense?**

That’s the structure of your worry, as I understand it: it’s a three-front attack on concreteness, fundamentality, and common sense as guides to “what there really is,” leaving the status of our ontological commitments deeply unclear.

Starting point of meaning:

1. Observable events (what's out there, directly observable)
2. Our judgement of the events (are they similar?)
3. Our explanation of the events (intentionality?)

Is it possible to deal with meaning with just 1 and 2? Linguistic laws would be like physics: correlation of things being refered to and the symbols. But we don't think correlations are "language"

stroke people language

uninterpretable language: tolo tolo tolo tolo? (one word language?)

explanation of linguistic behavior like natural phenomena? law of nature: "chair" comes with chair?

meaning of a sentence = truth condition? Why?

learning language stage and capable language user statge

 why do we ask how do we learn language? We try to understand how the mapping is created in the first place: what is mapped to what --> This task does not require inqury into learning language phase. The question emerges when we want to ask why? what's the rule for mapping?
 Why do we care about why? Disagreement about linguistic meaning: who wins? People seems to map the same symbol to different things.

1. how do we distinguish intentional events and non-intentional events? (some mind is involved)
2. how do we distinguish intentional, and linguistic events from non linguistic events? (it's expressing something)
3. how do we distinguish truth-apt linguitic expressions from non-truth-apt linguistic expression? (it's expressing some description)

for (1), not all events are intentional. Tornado moves, but we don't say tornado moves intentionally. Why?
for (2), not all sound we produce intentionally are considered "linguistic". We may intentionally produce knuckle cracking sound, but we don't think it's linguitic. Why?
for (3), not all linguitic event can be said to be true or false. For example, uttering "I promise to do something" is intentional, linguistic event, but this expression has no truth value. Why?

The reason I ask these three questions is that, I want to know when we say a sentence is true, what exactly do we presuppose? To say something is true or false, it first needs to be some linguistic expression. And linguistic expression needs intentionality. And being linguisitic expression is not enough to qualify as being truth apt. So we want to know what are the rules that we use to interpret some event that can be evaluated as being "truth apt"

metasemantics should not only ask how our words get their meanings. We should also ask, why do we treat something as words? We interpret some sound, signs or gestures as words. How? Out of what reason do we do that?
We interpret some (1) intentional actions that (2) express somthing as linguistic behavior. So there are some rules for judging whether something is , and judging some event is 
The problem is we almost subconsciously do that. We do not really infer. So what's the methodology?

A corollary of interpretative charity: all rules are automatically valid? But that seems strange: some rules are truth apt. Some seems not. e.g. mathematical rules are true/false. Moral rules are not. What about game rules? "There are biships" are true? Or not truth apt? What do you mean? What about moral rules? Why some rules can be truth-apt at all? Or are they rules at all? Why do we interpret these as rules?

Axioms as inference rule are RULES for derivations and deduction. Are they truth apt really? Formal models are constructed for rules, i.e. the kind of structure that rule specifies. (i.e. the situation/board where the game can be played) When is anything true?

"Wow" is not truth-apt, but "I am surprised" is truth-apt; "Ouch" is not truth-apt, but "I am in pain" is truth-apt. A lot of meaningful expressions are not truth-apt. So what is truth?

Alien semantics that has no concept of truth: all words are like "wow" or "ouch": they express some sort of mood or emotion. "There is a table" express the feeling of there being a table. (a truth-less language) But this language is surely meaningful.

Given that we don't interpret language in this way, we have a primitive state of mind where can be evaluated as true and false. What do we mean when we say we evaluate something as true or false, really? I think somewhere along verification or truth condition is essential. In order for something to be true, there must be some condition to appeal to.

Why we think "ouch" and "wow" don't have a truth value, dispite we know that they express something very similar to "I am in pain" and "I am surprised"? One response is, they don't express propostions. But why do we interpret them as not expressing propositions? Some expressions that take the form of a proposition, like "God bless you" isn't a proposition dispite its surface grammer. When asked "where's the book?", we also interpret the answer "On the table" as truth-apt dispite it lacks the surface grammar of a proposition. Explaining truth in terms of "expressing a proposition" is still not explaining.

Briefness, and the tone of "ouch" and "wow" seems to be a reason. It's because when we are in pain or superised, we (ordinary people, at least) have involuntary response. So we think these expressions are more of involuntary behavior, like people shivers when they are cold: we can infer the feeling of cold from the shiver, but we don't think the shiver intend to express some fact.

Again, if we just think languistic expressions have meaning just because it gives us inference, and when we say something it's just disposition, then there is no good reason to distinguish "wow" and "I am superised". There's something more than inferential role and dispositions: a special state of mind that is "about the world". When saying "I am superised", I am in a mental state where I intend to express something about the world. When I say "wow", I'm not.

But one can surely secretly think "wow" to be an abbreviation of "I am superised". There is no behavioral difference between those who think in this way. In fact, the skepticism is: how do you know "wow" in English is not truth-apt? Maybe all English speakers are interpreting "wow" as "I am superised", except you? Or maybe more plausibly, maybe there is a community where they interpret "wow" as simply short for "I am superised", is there any thing wrong about their language?

RM: Either they follow the same rule but make absurd mistake; Or they follow different but absurd rules. Either way, there are some absurdities: either we don't understand their way of following rules (i.e. the disagreement is on what are "rules"), or we don't understand their way of forming rules (agree on what rules are, but disagree on which one to follow).

Can rules be evaluated as true and false? It seems so: when we say, in chess, there are bishops, this is true as long as chess has a definite referent. But in chess seems necessary for evaluation. There are no bishop in sodoku. Is the bare sentence "there are bishops" true, without adding "in chess"? This is like asking whether "there are numbers" is true without adding "in peano axiom".

Interpretive charity: all rules are automatically valid.

Valid in what? Valid in the models that satisfies the rule, for sure. But is the rule valid *in reality*?

We have some guesses of meanings in the first place, and we attach these guesses to words. We don't have to really understand the referent: ordinary understand electrons like balls roaming around atoms. I can talk about electrons.

**The ultimate question: are ontological dispute merely verbal?**

The problem is, if both party are saying something true, and both party can interpret each other's semantics, then according to Hirsch, it is merely a verbal dispute.

**Thought experiment: fasting thinking human need no language**.

Assume we can calculate extremely fast, and we explain people's utterance as the output of a turin machine. We don't need any interpretation of thoughts, for all behvaiors can be explained by the configuration of a TM. If we do that, then there wouldn't be a difference between shivering while cold and speaking. Only when we interpret meanings in terms of mental states can linguistic behavior be "meaningful" at all. In other words, there are language at all because we this is the easiest way to explain the behavior.

Surely meaning is something mental: interpretation is merely a "guess". Meaning is the mental states themselves, not the interpretation of mental states.

**The hope for a heavyweight meaning: truth is not arbitrary, but rely on how we represent the world**

What is the aim of ontology? If representation could be arbitrary, then ontology is arbitrary, and there is no right or wrong at all. Our aim is to understand the concept of truth. Explaning misrepresentation might be the key.

naturalize intentionality?

**One the ontological status of disgustingness and color: A matter of language use:**

Some people think slugs are disgusting. Just from the surface grammar, it seems we are ascribing the property of "disgusting" to slugs, in the same way we acribe "green" to plants. We are not saying "I am digusted by slugs", which is describing our own mental states. However, we may grow up and no longer disgusted by slugs. The problem is we don't think slugs changed. It's us that changed and no longer feel disgust. We wouldn't say "it's still a disgusting slug, dispite I can no longer sense the disgust". We would be likely to say "it's disgusting to me". However, when we see a red tree, and then become color blind, we still say, it is a red tree instead of saying, "it is no longer red to me". Therefore, dispite the surface grammer, we seems to think the property "disgusting" is quite different from "red". Now the problem is, if our perception is always about something out here, how come we don't ascribe the concept of "disgusting"? Why don't we say, "disgusting" is some disjunctive physical properties?

I think the answer is that, we actually can, but we are not guestured to use the word "disgusting" in this way. For example, we are willing to retract our judgment about red when people point out when there's some abnormality in the lighting condition. However, when we say something is disgusting, we are not disposed to retract even if someone points out we are in some special condition. Due to the possibility of hallucination, we can't say this kind of guesture can still make the word "disgusting" refer to something "external and real", or at least it is something relational. We can still say some physical properties is disgusting relavant to someone, given someone's state. But we cannot say these physical properties are disgusting, period.

In other words, whether some predicate is in fact relational or just real in itself depends on how we use these words. Whether something is dependent on us or not depends on whether we would retract our judgment. We fixed the reference of "red" by the sensation of red. But it is possible for us to retract that there's no red present. This is not the case for "disgusting".

A further problem, however, is why we have this distinction at all. Why we tend to use "disgusting" in a way that we refuse to retract our judgment, but use "red" in a way that we are? Now we have a "Euthyphro dilemma": the property is (in)dependent of us because we use language in a certain way, or we use language in a certain way because the property is (in)dependent of us?

**Ultra-charitable intepretation**: when we play chess and someone moves a pawn like a queen, our normal reaction is, "You are cheating!". But maybe there is a ultra-charitable player. They would say, "You must be playing a very strange variant of chess." The problem here is, if we stick to interpretive charity, nothing can be false

**The uncloseability of the explanatory gap**: The explanatory gap is unclosable because we explain everything in terms of thoughts, including intentional thoughts about external world. But when it comes to why we have such and such thought at all, we hit the bottom.

Why do I think sense is intentional objects? Some feature of intentional objects: we can intend something and tend to believe it exist and talk about it, but it does not has to exist. (if you are trying to find something, then it only makes sense if you think it exists.) Regarding perception, the "object in the world" vs. "object the we perceive" might be different?

When we say we try to find something, we do intend something that we are ontologically commited to, but it does not actually has to exist. But not everything we can talk or think about has to has ontological commitment: unicorns and sherlockohms does not have ontological commitment altogether. In other words, we simply have the ability to intend something, period. We can attach ontological commitment to it, or we don't. But can we intend something without having no idea what that is? "I am thinking about something -- I have no idea what that is" -- that seems insane. We at least need some clue about what the object we are intending. We need some weak description attached to it.
So the psychology is, we have some clue, and the clue may or may not lead to anything. We may even intend "ontological un-commitment". For numbers, I believe it's not clear we have any ontological commitment. And when we perceive, we automatically attach ontological commitment to it. Whatsoever, our intentional object is pretty different from what is really out there (i.e. what's really out there = what we have ontological commiment). Way of intending: through "clues". (e.g. I intend the object which someone else is intending to -- a "clue", but not a vivid one. We attach more ontological commitment when we have a vivid clue).
Clue (way of intending) -- intended object -- ontological object
the special part of ontological object is that we are gestured to retract? Why do we retract? Hallucination: the clue fails to be a clue for the intended object, i.e. the clue does not guarantee the intended object?
