What is semantics? We have linguistic behaviors. These behaviors encode our thoughts; And we decode other people's thought by interpreting other people's behabvior of uttering words in a context. 

Starting intuition: out of all entities we talk about, we privilige some instead of others. For example, we say tables, chairs, rocks and cats are really something out there; But though we talk about promises, holes, prime numbers and shadows, we do not think they "really exist", or at least not "as real as" tables and chairs. What does this "real" here mean is a great great mystery. 

Why we make this distinction at all?

Is there a difference between these "not really exist" things and "really not exist" things, like unicorns? Surely, holes and promises are things that do exist in some sense. So their ontological status is, once again, special. Now it seems we say there are things that "heavily exist", "thinly exist" and "does not exist".

Now the task is to explain, why we think there are so many "ways of existence". Is there anything deep to it? Or is it just a psychological matter?

What should philosophy do? There are something that comes at the first glance. For example, at my first glance, there is a table. And maybe by reflection, I realize what I have is an experience of seeing a table. This could be an illusion, or a dream. But as long as it isn't, an explanation for having this experience is that, there is a table out there that causes the experience. The first-glance thought might be something called "intuition". This carries our actual ontological commitment. But it says nothing about whether we are justified, or rational in commiting to them ontologically. What makes this intuition rational or justified, it seems, it that, it *explains* why we have sensory experiences. Therefore, it's not only we have the ontological commitment of a table by default, but also we have a reason for it: it explains why we have those sensory experiences. But it's not enough for us to have a reason for us. In order to justify our commitment, it seems we need a *good* reason. It seems obviously not rational to say, we think earth is flat for the reason that pigs can't actually fly. But what if I really formed the belief that earth is flat due to the reason that pigs can't actually fly? Normally we would say these two facts are not relavant. But why these two facts are not relavant, but there being a table in front of me is relavant to me having such and such perceptual experience? 

Then now the question is, what exactly do we mean when we say "there being a table explains I saw a table", and why this count as a good reason for "there being a table" to be true. 

### 1. Starting intuition: “concrete existence” feels privileged

1.1. In ordinary thinking, we distinguish between **concrete things** (tables, chairs, rocks, cats) and **non-concrete things** (promises, holes, prime numbers, shadows).

1.2. We’re happy, in everyday language, to say that there _are_ promises, holes, prime numbers, and shadows. But we also have an inclination to say that they don’t exist in quite the same way that tables and chairs exist.

1.3. This often gets expressed as a sense that only concrete objects **“really” exist**, or have a privileged, fully robust form of existence. Everything else exists in some thinner, derivative, or merely conceptual way.

1.4. So there seems to be a **metaphysical value** attached to concreteness: when we do serious ontology, we feel pressure to treat the concrete as the primary or “real” part of what there is.

### 2. The “concrete” / “non-concrete” line becomes blurry

2.1. The more we look at modern physics, the stranger “concreteness” becomes.

2.2. Consider **quantum entities** (electrons, quarks, quantum fields) and **electromagnetic fields**. Are these “concrete” in the same sense as tables and chairs? They don’t look or behave like solid, medium-sized objects at all.

2.3. Even familiar objects like atoms are strange: most of the volume of an atom is “empty space” in some sense. Yet tables and chairs are built from atoms.

2.4. So if concreteness is tied to intuitive ideas like “solid stuff in space,” then the things we regard as paradigmatically concrete (tables and chairs) are made out of things that don’t fit that intuitive picture.

2.5. This suggests that **“concrete” is not a stable or well-defined ontological category**. It works well at the level of common sense, but under scientific scrutiny it becomes unclear where exactly to draw the boundary.

2.6. Therefore, any ontological program that says “only concrete things really exist” is threatened by the fact that the notion of concreteness itself becomes problematic in light of our best theories.

---

### 3. Dropping the “only concrete exists” constraint doesn’t solve things

3.1. Suppose we give up the restriction that we should only be ontologically committed to concrete entities. Then we allow that abstract or non-concrete entities might also be part of what there is.

3.2. Once we do this, a new problem appears: **what, exactly, should we commit to**?

3.3. One extreme view would be: commit to _everything_ that we can talk about—promises, holes, numbers, shadows, fictional characters, etc.

3.4. But that seems wrong: we **do want a distinction** between:

- entities that are “really” there (electrons, people, trees, maybe numbers), and
    
- entities that are purely fictional or merely imaginary (Sherlock Holmes, unicorns, etc.).
    

3.5. If we treat all referents of our discourse as equally real, we lose this important **real/fictional** (or real/merely-imagined) distinction. That seems unacceptable for an adequate ontology.

3.6. So even when we stop privileging concreteness, we still face the problem: how do we draw principled lines in our ontology? Which entities earn serious ontological commitment, and which don’t?

---

### 4. Attempted solution: privilege the “fundamental”

4.1. A natural response is: maybe we should give **ontological priority** to whatever is **most fundamental**.

4.2. On this picture, there may be many real things—tables, chairs, promises, numbers—but some things are **more basic** than others. The rest depend on, or are grounded in, those fundamental entities.

4.3. Then we might say: our deepest ontological commitment should be to the fundamental level; everything else is derivative, or perhaps even dispensable.

4.4. However, there is deep disagreement over **what counts as fundamental**:

- A **physicalist** might say: the fundamental entities are physical particles, fields, spacetime, or whatever physics ultimately says exists. Tables and chairs are constructed out of those; abstracta are mere abstractions from the concrete physical realm.
    
- A **Platonist** (in a strong sense) might say: the fundamental entities are Platonic Forms or abstract structures. The physical world is derivative, a kind of shadow or imperfect realization of these Forms.
    

4.5. On the Platonist picture, tables and chairs may end up looking “less real” or “illusory” relative to the Forms, just as on physicalism numbers or Forms might be treated as mere conceptual entities derived from physical processes.

4.6. The key point: **each side can claim fundamentality for its preferred entities** and demote or “deflate” the other’s favorite entities as illusory, derivative, or mere appearances.

4.7. Thus, appeal to fundamentality **by itself** does not settle the ontological question; without an independent way to decide what is fundamental, the notion of fundamentality risks just re-labeling our prior biases.

---

### 5. Another attempt: follow common sense ontology

5.1. Another possible strategy: perhaps our ontological commitments should largely align with **common sense**.

5.2. In everyday life, people straightforwardly commit to:

- tables, chairs, cats, persons,  
    and they do **not** commit to:
    
- high-dimensional manifolds, quantum wavefunctions, and other theoretical exotica.
    

5.3. So one might think: our ontology should treat as “real” roughly the things that ordinary thought and language treats as real.

5.4. This would make middle-sized objects, persons, and so on central, and would be suspicious of entities that are only posited by sophisticated scientific or mathematical theories.

5.5. But here a normative problem arises. The fact that we _do_ commit, in practice, to tables and chairs doesn’t by itself entail that we _ought to_ commit to them in our best metaphysical theory.

5.6. This mirrors the familiar **is–ought gap**: from a description of what we _in fact do_ (our ordinary ontological assumptions), it does not straightforwardly follow what we _should_ believe about reality.

5.7. So an appeal to common sense seems, at best, to give us data about our current conceptual scheme, not a justification for what the correct ontology must be.

---

### 6. The resulting puzzle

6.1. We began with an intuitive distinction between **concrete** and **non-concrete** entities and a corresponding feeling that only the concrete “really” exist.

6.2. But closer examination shows that **concreteness is unstable** as a metaphysical category, especially once we consider contemporary physics and the structure of matter.

6.3. Dropping the insistence on concreteness leaves us with a new problem: how to avoid **ontological inflation**, where we treat everything we can talk about (including fictional characters) as equally real.

6.4. A natural move is to say: we should primarily commit to what is **fundamental**, with other entities being derivative. But competing metaphysical pictures disagree radically on what is fundamental (physical vs abstract, matter vs Forms), and we lack a neutral criterion that picks out the correct notion of fundamentality.

6.5. Turning instead to **common sense** looks tempting, but that seems to confuse our actual, historically contingent patterns of belief with what we _ought_ to believe about reality. The mere fact that ordinary people believe in tables but not manifolds doesn’t resolve the metaphysical question.

6.6. So we arrive at a genuine **problem about ontological commitment**:

- Concreteness won’t cleanly sort the real from the unreal.
    
- Fundamentality is itself up for grabs and can be claimed by radically different theories.
    
- Common sense doesn’t seem to give us a normatively authoritative guide.
    

6.7. Hence the core question emerges: **What principle or method—if any—can tell us what we should be ontologically committed to, and how to justify that commitment, without relying on shaky notions like concreteness, ungrounded claims about fundamentality, or an uncritical appeal to common sense?**

That’s the structure of your worry, as I understand it: it’s a three-front attack on concreteness, fundamentality, and common sense as guides to “what there really is,” leaving the status of our ontological commitments deeply unclear.
