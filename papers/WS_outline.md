### High-level tension

- If we throw away all of our intuition, we cannot establish any conclusion; 
- If we rely on intuition, our intuition may not reveal the reality, and may be shaky and unreliable. I can have an intuition that I am Jesus.

### Motivating question

**How much reality should we read off our language?** (Which part of our "picture of reality" is a construction of our language, and which part of it is mere linguistic construction?)

*Examples:* 

1. In our ordinary speech we say **something is good and bad, and things can have purpose**. Is this a part of the construction, or really out there in the reality?
2. Our language has subjects and predicates; But **is the reality composed of objects and properties?** (This is a non-trivial question. Consider a one-word language where they don't have the linguistic structure of subjects and predicates. Do they miss our some important feature of the world?)
3. In the language of quantum physics, the reality can just be expressed by a bunch of waves (or maybe a huge wave). But should we read reality off schodinger equation and say, **we are really just waves that exist in probabilistic state?**

#### Why this question?

**Truth is not enough for metaphysics** (Warning: This is a heavyweight idea)

Uttering truth does not automatically guarantee you get the reality. For example, given a language, it is trivially true to say, there are numbers, there are objects, there are moral properties. But the problem is whether it's our *linguistic rules* that make them true, or it's the *reality* that makes them true.

#### Three ways to answer the question

- **Never-ism**: Reality is unspeakable, we can never read reality off our language
- **Sometimes-ism**: There are some privileged languages where we can read reality off these languages (or part of it). For example, Quinean metaphysics think our ordinary language is fucked up, but we can paraphrase it in some way. And we can read the entities off the paraphrased language.
- **Always-ism**: As long as languages are truth-functionally equivalent, there is no privileged language; And we can always read reality off the language. If there is a language that says numbers exists, and you are able to really think in that language, then you can read numbers off the language without further constraint.

### Fundamentality

We do have a very strong intuition to say one thing is more basic or more fundamental than another. For example, the particles that composes a table seems more fundamental than the table. Most importantly, this relationship of fundamentality is *asymmetric* (to emphasize, it is anti-symmetric and irreflexive). But does this come from our language, or the reality?

In our language, we do have things like **explanation** and **definition**. And we do have an intuition that, the explanation is more fundamental than the explained; The definition is more fundamental than the defined. But surely our linguistic practice very oftenly violates this. For example, we may define *gure* in terms of *blue* and *green*; But we also acknowledge the possiblity to define *blue* in terms of *grue* and *bleen*. This also applies to explanation.

#### Problems for establishing asymmetry

1. **Naturalness**: The more natural things are more fundamental; e.g. blue is more fundamental than grue
	- **Problem**: If "being natural" could vary in different languages, then there are different frameworks of fundamentality
	- **Solution 1**: Reference magenitism
		- **Problem**: Reference magnetism doesn't exist
	- **Solution 2**: We can learn from the world what's truely natural. Grue is unnatural because grue-induction fails.
		- **Problem**: There's no problem with grue-induction.

2. **Essense**: The essense of A is more fundamental than A itself; e.g. the essense of $\{Socrates\}$ is (roughly speaking) Socrates; Thus Socrates is more fundamental than $\{Socrates\}$
	- **Problem**: Again, if "being essense" could vary in different languages, then there are different frameworks of fundamentality.
	- **Solution**: Appeal to intuition: isn't it clear that, Socrates is more fundamental than $\{Socrates\}$?
		- **Problem 1**: Mathematically speaking, set formation has nothing to do with intrinsicality. Our intuition that *a member of a set* is somehow intrinsic to *a set* is our interpretation of set formation, especially with the ordinary language words like "member" and how we use the notation. But we could have used the notations otherwise so that this intuition does not come up for set formation.
		- **Problem 2**: Imagine a set-theoretic creature who see everything as a singleton set. And by theoretical reconstruction they can realize what they see includes `Socrates`. They would be happy to say, the essense of `Socrates` is $\{Socrates\}$ because `Socrates` is their theoretical construction from what they directly see. Is there anything wrong with this creature?

3. **Grounding**: A is more fundamental than B if A grounds B
	- **Problem**: small-g view is more plausible, but the relations under small-g are also not immune to the skepticism of semantic variance. There is always an alternative strange relationship that fuck things up

**Upshot**: The only hope for the semantic invariance seems to be, the world can tell us whether we are using the right concept. But if we are willing to throw away all of our intuition and imagine strange creatures, then the world cannot teach us anything.

#### The way out

There are some intuitions that we cannot throw away (or at least should not throw away).

**The Principle of Sanity**: For someone who is capable of philosophical reflection, it is impossible to genuinely believe oneself to not be a rational agent.

I will defend different versions of this principle.

- The **weak version** is less controversial: the "rational agent" in the principle is understood as someone who has *epistemic agency* (which is compatible with solipsism)
- The **strong version**, I think, is still not controversial (except for Aengus): the "rational agent" in the principle is understood as someone who are *moral agents* (the arguement, however, is still linguistic: we need language for philosophical reflection, but for human beings, we can only learn languages through social interaction)

Consequences of the weak principle:

1. We cannot eliminate metaphysical concepts that are necessitated by epistemic agency: first person pronoun (Eli Hirsch), causation
2. The concepts necessitated by epistemic agency stays invariant in different languages that we can adopt (e.g. 'I' must stay invariant; Parfitian language will defeat my rational agency. Similarly for causation)
3. If causation can be explained by agency, then we can perfer the analysis of causation in terms of interventionist model. And we can establish fundamentality in terms of metaphysical causation (through an interventionist model)

Consequences of the strong principle:

1. **Moral agency requires social interaction**: According to Rousseau, Bernerd Williams, (Eli Hirsch), and maybe Aristotle, we cannot have an "ethical sense of self" without social interaction with other person. 
2. **Social interaction requires trust**: But for any meaningful social interaction (talking to each other, making promises, cooperating others), one must presuppose a sense of *truthfulness* -- you cannot assume other people are behaving in a way that is intentionality misleading, or none of these interactions make sense. To assume truthfulness of others is to trust others.
3. **Traditional Epistemic Rationality**: we should only believe P when the reason for believing tracks the truth.
4. Therefore, if by friend we mean the people who we majorly interact with socially, the stonger version of *the principle of sanity* will be violated if (1) we always follow the traditional epistemic rationality, and (2) frequently there are evidence against our friend's words. So in this painful situation, if we don't want to be insane, our epistemic norm should allow us to believe our friends' words against evidence
