### High-level tension

- If we throw away all of our intuition, we cannot establish any conclusion; 
- If we rely on intuition, our intuition may not reveal the reality, and may be shaky and unreliable. I can have an intuition that I am Jesus.

### Motivating question

**How much reality should we read off our language?** (Which part of our "picture of reality" is a construction of our language, and which part of it is mere linguistic construction?)

*Examples:* 

1. In our ordinary speech we say **something is good and bad, and things can have purpose**. Is this a part of the construction, or really out there in the reality?
2. Our language has subjects and predicates; But **is the reality composed of objects and properties?** (This is a non-trivial question. Consider a one-word language where they don't have the linguistic structure of subjects and predicates. Do they miss our some important feature of the world?)
3. In the language of quantum physics, the reality can just be expressed by a bunch of waves (or maybe a huge wave). But should we read reality off schodinger equation and say, **we are really just waves that exist in probabilistic state?**

**Truth is not enough for metaphysics** (Warning: This is a heavyweight idea)

Uttering truth does not automatically guarantee you get the reality. For example, given a language, it is trivially true to say, there are numbers, there are objects, there are moral properties. But the problem is whether it's our *linguistic rules* that make them true, or it's the *reality* that makes them true.

#### Three ways to answer the question

- **Never-ism**: Reality is unspeakable, we can never read reality off our language
- **Sometimes-ism**: There are some privileged languages where we can read reality off these languages (or part of it). For example, Quinean metaphysics think our ordinary language is fucked up, but we can paraphrase it in some way. And we can read the entities off the paraphrased language.
- **Always-ism**: As long as languages are truth-functionally equivalent, there is no privileged language; And we can always read reality off the language. If there is a language that says numbers exists, and you are able to really think in that language, then you can read numbers off the language without further constraint.

### Fundamentality

We do have a very strong intuition to say one thing is more basic or more fundamental than another. For example, the particles that composes a table seems more fundamental than the table. Most importantly, this relationship of fundamentality is *asymmetric* (to emphasize, it is anti-symmetric and irreflexive). But does this come from our language, or the reality?

In our language, we do have things like **explanation** and **definition**. And we do have an intuition that, the explanation is more fundamental than the explained; The definition is more fundamental than the defined. But surely our linguistic practice very oftenly violates this. For example, we may define *gure* in terms of *blue* and *green*; But we also acknowledge the possiblity to define *blue* in terms of *grue* and *bleen*. This also applies to explanation.
