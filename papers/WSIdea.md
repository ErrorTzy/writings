All names may have

(1) representation, and 
(2) inferential rules

(1) might be deferred to the community. We need representation to really make sense of something being really there. And not all representation counts: a painting, a statue (representation of representation) may not be a sufficient representation for us to say, it is really there. All we can is a painting and a statue is there.

A priori entities leaves (1) blank. Fictional entities deny that there can ever be (1).

On the relativity of Goodman's puzzle:

In your philosophy of science class, you told us about the Goodman's puzzle of induction. Goodman's puzzle seems to suggest that, if grue is problematic, then naturalness is objective: only natural properties can sustain induction. (I believe there are other ways to answer the riddle; But I assume here naturalness use its capacity to solve the riddle to show its objectivity.) But recently I found that it turns out the grue-induction is perfectly reliable. If that is so, then different conceptual schemes will have different attribution of naturalness. But I know from Ted Sider that naturalness is supposed to be absolute, and there can only be one true naturalness that carves the world at its joints. And there's even a natural quantifier. But I don't know how naturalness can be objective and invariant in different conceptual scheme. Given you are a Lewisian, I figure you must know much more than me. So I want to ask you if there are any other argument that might establish the objectivity or absoluteness of naturalness in different conceptual schemes, and if my understanding of the Goodman's riddle missed some points.

Let me try to recap Goodman's riddle. The the argument goes, given that all the emeralds observed before 2050 are grue, induction will tell us the first emerald observed in 2050 is also grue. But we know emeralds are green. Therefore, the grue-induction is wrong. But the form of the induction is right. So we must blame the concept of grue.

But in this proof, why we should we assume that, all emeralds are green? Presumably, we know this by induction: all observed emeralds are green. Maybe we take "being green" as an essence of the kind "emerald". But why should the grue people accept this? By the same token, grue people will define "emeralds" in grue English as being a grue stone. And they may take the essence of the "emerald" as being grue. If we show grue people a green emerald in 2051, they would say, "this is not what we call emeralds, because it's not grue." Then it turns out their induction is perfectly reliable: what they call "emeralds" are indeed grue. 

In other words, induction depend on kind because induction projects observed to unobserved within a kind. But the meaning of a kind term, however, is determined by what kind of induction it allows to make, as long as the kind is not vague. "Fish" as a biological kind rules out whales because induction on being a non-mammal fails on whales. But "fish" as an ordinary kind may include whales because it allows induction regarding being fish-like. Therefore, if the grue people use the word "emeralds" at all, and do grue-induction on emeralds, then the meaning of "emeralds" in grue English must be different from emeralds in our English. 

Of course the above picture might be overly simple. I assumed that the kind "emeralds" is defined by its color. Then it is a priori true that our emeralds are green and grue-English "emeralds" are grue. But assume grue people and us both agree that emeralds are defined by its chemical structure ZYX, not its greeness. Then in our science, by induction, we can have a law of nature that ZYX necessitates greenness. But in grue science, by induction they will have a law of nature that ZYX necessitates grue-ness. And when 2050 comes, this laws of grue will be falsified. Then should we say, after all, we can do better science with green not grue? But it still doesn't seem to be the case. First, this kind of induction failure is acceptable. For example, we may induct swan on being white. But the existence of a black swan does not make the term "white" problematic. Second, our science is better than grue science only if laws of nature does not necessitate strange properties like grue. But why would grue science accept this principle? After all, from the point of view from grue people, it's us who are using strange properties. And even if laws of natural indeed happens to contain no such properties, grue science can eventually find out ZYX necessitates green instead of grue. The virtue of adopting green instead of blue merely seems pragmatic.

But this argument shows that, laws of nature specifies natural properties. And as long as laws of nature are objective, then naturalness is objective. All the properties that laws of nature necessitates are natural. Given the laws of nature shows that all emeralds are green, then should we conclude that, after all, grue is metaphysically defective? This line of critique is true only if the law of nature is really that, all emeralds are green. But given that we haven't reached 2050 yet, how can we conclude from the observed cases that, the law of nature is: emeralds are green, not emeralds are grue? And even after 2050, we can still define another concept "grue*" such that it is green and observed before 2051, or blue and unobserved before 2051. In fact, there are infinitely many grue-like concepts that observed cases have. What would be the reason for us to determine the laws of nature as just being "emeralds are green", instead of "emeralds are grue", or "emeralds are grue*"?

On referring to something essentially:

To refer to a property requires us to have a way to fix the reference. But it is not always the case that, out way to fix the reference is absolutely reliable. In some cases, we may correctly use the reference-fixing property but still refer to the wrong kind of referent.  

Kripke made a distinction between two ways of referring. The first way is called referring essentially. For example, "pain" necessarily picks out the property of being in pain. We cannot make any mistake in judging if we are in pain. Even if we feel pain due to hallucination, we still think that we are in pain. The second way is called referring non-essentially. For example, we may use "being a stable yellow metal" to fix the referent of "being gold". But we may be shown evidence that, the underlying structure is not actually Au, but fool's gold. Therefore, the reference-fixing property does not fix the referent essentially.

The problem began with a puzzle regarding the semantics of color terms, like "purple". Color terms do not seem to fit neatly into the standard categories. They are unlike natural kind terms such as "gold," because we don't appear to treat "purple" as rigidly designating a single, unique physical microstructure. This is evidenced by the problem of metamers: we would call two physically distinct surfaces "purple" if they looked identical, which is disanalogous to how we treat "fool's gold."

However, color terms are also unlike terms for mental states like "pain," where appearance is reality. We acknowledge that we can be mistaken about an object's color due to abnormal lighting or perceptual conditions, suggesting an objective component.

To resolve this tension, we can have a two-step model for how we fix the reference of these terms. The first step is an initial application based on a perceptual or descriptive standard (e.g., "looks purple"). The crucial second step involves appealing to a "normality standard" to determine the property being rigidly designated. My central thesis is that the location of this standard differs critically. For "gold," the standard is internal to the object—its shared microstructural essence. For "purple," the standard is external and relational—it concerns the normality of the perceptual conditions (i.e., a standard observer and standard lighting). Thus, the "unity" of the kind "purple" is not determined by a shared physical structure, but by the unified response of our perceptual systems.

On my view, the reference of "purple" is fixed by a functional role: the disposition to cause a certain experience in normal observers. It is compatible with physicalism that, the term ultimately refers to the purely physical properties (the set of Surface Spectral Reflectance profiles) that realize this function.

However, there is a deeper problem. Why are we using these terms in this way? In the case of "pain", we deny that we could ever be corrected by showing any evidence. Even illusion of pain count as pain. In the case of "purple", we allow ourselves to be correctly by the evidence that, we are in an abnormal lighting condition, or we are having illusion. But apart from that, no evidence can correct our judgement that something is purple. In the case of "gold", not only we could be corrected by showing that we are in an abnormal perceptual situation, we could also be corrected by showing that the thing does not have the same underlying structure as what we normally called gold.

Let me try to answer this quesion. In the case of "pain", the reference fixing property (painful sensation) is just the referent itself. As long as we correctly apply the reference fixing property, we get the referent. In the case of "purple", the reference fixing property (purple experience) is not the referent. The referent is supposed to be something worldly. And we want to directly talk about the kind of property that would lead us to have red experience. And this requires that we need to fix the perceptual situation with the object that causes us to have this sentation. If we don't fix the perceptual situation, then we can't get to talk about what we want to talk about. We want to talk about some property on the object's surface, not the surrounding enviornment. In terms of gold, however, we are not interested in what kind of experience it would cause us to have an experience of seeing a yellow metal. Instead, we may be interested in its role played in chemical reaction. Therefore, we could discover that, it's role is explained by the physical structure of Au. Therefore, we distinguish fool's gold from real gold.

(I believe this is plausible. But this has a sweeping consequence: it turns out that natural kinds are actually interest relative, and are actually functional kinds in disguise. Only if we treat "scientific function" as natural can we really say something is a natural kind.)


On motivation:

Deflationism is powerful. Their argument seems convincing. No one can deny that, all our philosophical work depend on our conceptual scheme and our language. We can't do philosophy without it. But the consequence of a thorough Carnapian deflationism is utterly insane: Eventually we can't say how the world REALLY is. All we can say is something true relative to a conceptual scheme. How can everything be a matter of language? It can't be the case that all we can talk about is how to use our language, not about the world. To say this is to destroy metaphysics for good.
