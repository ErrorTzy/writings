All names may have

(1) representation, and

(1) might be deferred to the community. We need representation to really make sense of something being really there. And not all representation counts: a painting, a statue (representation of representation) may not be a sufficient representation for us to say, it is really there. All we can is a painting and a statue is there.

A priori entities leaves (1) blank. Fictional entities deny that there can ever be (1).

## On the relativity of Goodman's puzzle:

In your philosophy of science class, you told us about the Goodman's puzzle of induction. Goodman's puzzle seems to suggest that, if grue is problematic, then naturalness is objective: only natural properties can sustain induction. (I believe there are other ways to answer the riddle; But I assume here naturalness use its capacity to solve the riddle to show its objectivity.) But recently I found that it turns out the grue-induction is perfectly reliable. If that is so, then different conceptual schemes will have different attribution of naturalness. But I know from Ted Sider that naturalness is supposed to be absolute, and there can only be one true naturalness that carves the world at its joints. And there's even a natural quantifier. But I don't know how naturalness can be objective and invariant in different conceptual scheme. Given you are a Lewisian, I figure you must know much more than me. So I want to ask you if there are any other argument that might establish the objectivity or absoluteness of naturalness in different conceptual schemes, and if my understanding of the Goodman's riddle missed some points.

Let me try to recap Goodman's riddle. The the argument goes, given that all the emeralds observed before 2050 are grue, induction will tell us the first emerald observed in 2050 is also grue. But we know emeralds are green. Therefore, the grue-induction is wrong. But the form of the induction is right. So we must blame the concept of grue.

But in this proof, why we should we assume that, all emeralds are green? Presumably, we know this by induction: all observed emeralds are green. Maybe we take "being green" as an essence of the kind "emerald". But why should the grue people accept this? By the same token, grue people will define "emeralds" in grue English as being a grue stone. And they may take the essence of the "emerald" as being grue. If we show grue people a green emerald in 2051, they would say, "this is not what we call emeralds, because it's not grue." Then it turns out their induction is perfectly reliable: what they call "emeralds" are indeed grue. 

In other words, induction depend on kind because induction projects observed to unobserved within a kind. But the meaning of a kind term, however, is determined by what kind of induction it allows to make, as long as the kind is not vague. "Fish" as a biological kind rules out whales because induction on being a non-mammal fails on whales. But "fish" as an ordinary kind may include whales because it allows induction regarding being fish-like. Therefore, if the grue people use the word "emeralds" at all, and do grue-induction on emeralds, then the meaning of "emeralds" in grue English must be different from emeralds in our English. 

Of course the above picture might be overly simple. I assumed that the kind "emeralds" is defined by its color. Then it is a priori true that our emeralds are green and grue-English "emeralds" are grue. But assume grue people and us both agree that emeralds are defined by its chemical structure ZYX, not its greeness. Then in our science, by induction, we can have a law of nature that ZYX necessitates greenness. But in grue science, by induction they will have a law of nature that ZYX necessitates grue-ness. And when 2050 comes, this laws of grue will be falsified. Then should we say, after all, we can do better science with green not grue? But it still doesn't seem to be the case. First, this kind of induction failure is acceptable. For example, we may induct swan on being white. But the existence of a black swan does not make the term "white" problematic. Second, our science is better than grue science only if laws of nature does not necessitate strange properties like grue. But why would grue science accept this principle? After all, from the point of view from grue people, it's us who are using strange properties. And even if laws of natural indeed happens to contain no such properties, grue science can eventually find out ZYX necessitates green instead of grue. The virtue of adopting green instead of blue merely seems pragmatic.

But this argument shows that, laws of nature specifies natural properties. And as long as laws of nature are objective, then naturalness is objective. All the properties that laws of nature necessitates are natural. Given the laws of nature shows that all emeralds are green, then should we conclude that, after all, grue is metaphysically defective? This line of critique is true only if the law of nature is really that, all emeralds are green. But given that we haven't reached 2050 yet, how can we conclude from the observed cases that, the law of nature is: emeralds are green, not emeralds are grue? And even after 2050, we can still define another concept "grue*" such that it is green and observed before 2051, or blue and unobserved before 2051. In fact, there are infinitely many grue-like concepts that observed cases have. What would be the reason for us to determine the laws of nature as just being "emeralds are green", instead of "emeralds are grue", or "emeralds are grue*"?

## On referring to something essentially:

To refer to a property requires us to have a way to fix the reference. But it is not always the case that, out way to fix the reference is absolutely reliable. In some cases, we may correctly use the reference-fixing property but still refer to the wrong kind of referent.  

Kripke made a distinction between two ways of referring. The first way is called referring essentially. For example, "pain" necessarily picks out the property of being in pain. We cannot make any mistake in judging if we are in pain. Even if we feel pain due to hallucination, we still think that we are in pain. The second way is called referring non-essentially. For example, we may use "being a stable yellow metal" to fix the referent of "being gold". But we may be shown evidence that, the underlying structure is not actually Au, but fool's gold. Therefore, the reference-fixing property does not fix the referent essentially.

The problem began with a puzzle regarding the semantics of color terms, like "purple". Color terms do not seem to fit neatly into the standard categories. They are unlike natural kind terms such as "gold," because we don't appear to treat "purple" as rigidly designating a single, unique physical microstructure. This is evidenced by the problem of metamers: we would call two physically distinct surfaces "purple" if they looked identical, which is disanalogous to how we treat "fool's gold."

However, color terms are also unlike terms for mental states like "pain," where appearance is reality. We acknowledge that we can be mistaken about an object's color due to abnormal lighting or perceptual conditions, suggesting an objective component.

To resolve this tension, we can have a two-step model for how we fix the reference of these terms. The first step is an initial application based on a perceptual or descriptive standard (e.g., "looks purple"). The crucial second step involves appealing to a "normality standard" to determine the property being rigidly designated. My central thesis is that the location of this standard differs critically. For "gold," the standard is internal to the object—its shared microstructural essence. For "purple," the standard is external and relational—it concerns the normality of the perceptual conditions (i.e., a standard observer and standard lighting). Thus, the "unity" of the kind "purple" is not determined by a shared physical structure, but by the unified response of our perceptual systems.

On my view, the reference of "purple" is fixed by a functional role: the disposition to cause a certain experience in normal observers. It is compatible with physicalism that, the term ultimately refers to the purely physical properties (the set of Surface Spectral Reflectance profiles) that realize this function.

However, there is a deeper problem. Why are we using these terms in this way? In the case of "pain", we deny that we could ever be corrected by showing any evidence. Even illusion of pain count as pain. In the case of "purple", we allow ourselves to be correctly by the evidence that, we are in an abnormal lighting condition, or we are having illusion. But apart from that, no evidence can correct our judgement that something is purple. In the case of "gold", not only we could be corrected by showing that we are in an abnormal perceptual situation, we could also be corrected by showing that the thing does not have the same underlying structure as what we normally called gold.

Let me try to answer this quesion. In the case of "pain", the reference fixing property (painful sensation) is just the referent itself. As long as we correctly apply the reference fixing property, we get the referent. In the case of "purple", the reference fixing property (purple experience) is not the referent. The referent is supposed to be something worldly. And we want to directly talk about the kind of property that would lead us to have red experience. And this requires that we need to fix the perceptual situation with the object that causes us to have this sentation. If we don't fix the perceptual situation, then we can't get to talk about what we want to talk about. We want to talk about some property on the object's surface, not the surrounding enviornment. In terms of gold, however, we are not interested in what kind of experience it would cause us to have an experience of seeing a yellow metal. Instead, we may be interested in its role played in chemical reaction. Therefore, we could discover that, it's role is explained by the physical structure of Au. Therefore, we distinguish fool's gold from real gold.

(I believe this is plausible. But this has a sweeping consequence: it turns out that natural kinds are actually interest relative, and are actually functional kinds in disguise. Only if we treat "scientific function" as natural can we really say something is a natural kind.)

Upshot 2: we can create objects with essential properties, by stipulation. I say Aristotle is necessarily born from his parents, but he may not be human (Aristotle who mutated to a gorilla, say); While someone else says Aristotle is necessarily a human, but he may be born from some else (For example, his parents mutated to a gorilla, and then Aristotle mutates back to human). Then we refer to different objects by the name Aristotle.

## On motivation

While this paper is motivated by a question in metaphysics, the application of the idea I defend in this paper goes beyond metaphysics. At a very high level, the paper grapples with a central tension. On one hand, it seems all possible philosophical conclusion must ultimately rely on intuitive premises. ==Here, the word "premise" is used in a broad sense. For example, axiom schemas like modus ponens also count as premises in the relevant sense.== If so, then we cannot establish anything if we throw away all of our intuitions (or dispositions, sentiments, whatever). On the other hand, many of our intuitions seem shaky, unreliable or contingent. The problem, then, is to figure out which part of our intuition cannot (or at least, should not) be thrown away. 

I frist argue this tension indeed exists in (meta)metaphysics. This tension has been implicitly pointed out by a form of neo-Quinean argument, but somehow they still get ignored. The consequence is that, the recent trend in fundamentality is not immune to this neo-Carnapian critique. Then I defend the project of fundamentality against this critique. I argue for a principle that basically says we cannot throw away our rational agency. And I spend the rest of the paper exploring what follows from it. Mostly, I use it to establish the directness of fundamentality without magic. But I also included some consequences beyond metaphysics.

The starting point of this paper comes from the following question: How much reality should we read off our language? (Immediately, this may invite question like, what do I mean by reality. I mean what 'reality' means in ordinary language.) This is central to maybe all metaphysical problems. For example, almost all natural languages have a subject-predicate structure. Should we then say, the world itself is constituted of objects and properties? Grammatically we have predicates like 'good' or 'bad'. Then should we read them off our language and say there are such properties in the world? The proposition $P$ may seem syntactically more primitive than $\neg \neg P$. Should we read this structure off our language and say the *fact* that $P$ is in some sense more fundamental than the *fact* that $\neg \neg P$? Quantum physics describes the world in terms of wave functions. Should we then interpret that reality as just a bunch of waves (or maybe, a huge, holistic wave)?

There is of course a spectrum of views. On one extreme, we can never read anything off language. Kantian idealism seems to be this kind of *never-ism*. They may say any structure or category comes from the built-in categories of our cognition. We are simply projecting them onto reality. So, we can never know anything about reality *in itself*.

On the opposite pole, the thinking is that we can always read reality off some of our linguistic feature. This *always-ism* is less a single view and more a collection of ideas. For example, the "structured fact" view says that $F(x)$ is the same *fact* as $G(y)$ if and only if the $F \equiv G$ and $x=y$. A direct consequence of this is would be that $P$ is a different fact from $\neg \neg P$, as the syntax shows. 

Of course, there are also *sometimes-ism* in between. Armstrong, for instance, argued that we should only read predicates as real universals when those predicates pick out a genuine similarity in the world.

The way I've framed the question, i.e. how much reality we should read off our language, is a bit different from the standard story told in metametaphysics. I think the standard narrative, which I'll lay out in a moment, tends to miss something important. I take the familiar story told by ==Schaffer (2009)==, probably the most-cited paper in the field, as the orthodox version (though I'll be telling a bit differently).

**The standard story** 

It goes something like this: contemporary metaphysics began with the Quine-Carnap debate. After Quine arguably won the debate, his approach to metaphysics prevailed. For Quine, the main task of metaphysics is to figure out what indispensably exists. Whether numbers or electrons exist depends on whether we must quantify over them in our best theories. This methodology was extended to other topics. Lewis, in some sense, can be seen as following the Quinean methodology: Since our best account of modality requires quantifying over possible worlds, possible worlds are real. From there, other concepts can be analyzed. Causation is explained by counterfactuals, which are analyzed in terms of possible worlds. Modality de re can be reduced to modality de dicto, plus some pragmatic, context-sensitive similarities. The takeaway is that most problems in metaphysics can be solved by first figuring out what exists and then maybe add a dash of pragmatics.

But then, the neo-Carnapians entered the scene. I believe the most important the idea from the neo-Carnapians is that, the meaning of "exists" can vary. (I'm focusing on quantifier variance because I believe it's the most plausible and basic form of the neo-Carnapian position. Thomasson herself thinks her easy ontology doesn't depend on quantifier variance, but this is surely mistaken. Her project relies on the triviality of changing the extension of the predicate "exists". But this surely changes the meaning of the quantifier.) According to this view, when different people debate what exists, they are just speaking different languages. Imagine one side speaks A-language and the other speaks B-language. For any sentence uttered by either side, both A-speakers and B-speakers will have their respective interpretation the sentence. If the interpretation from each side always agrees on the truth value of the sentence, then it seems there's no real disagreement: They agree on all the facts; they're just expressing them differently. (This, of course, assumes that facts are unstructured, or they would be disagreeing on the structure of facts.) If that's the case, then many debates about what exists are merely verbal. (There are a lot can be said in the dialectics around quantifier variance, like collapse argument, reference magnetism, etc. which I cannot elaborate here. But I believe in the literature the general consensus has been that at least some version of quantifier variance is plausible and widely accepted)

The implication here is serious. If metaphysics is founded on questions of existence, but quantifier variance shows that there are many equally good meanings of "existence" and the debates are merely verbal, then metaphysics risks becoming a trivial field of study.

The Quinean picture also came under attack from a different direction: the neo-Aristotelians. They argued that even if we had a complete list of what exists, we'd still be missing something important: what is most fundamental, and what grounds what. Schaffer, for instance, argues that questions about existence are trivial. He says that of fictional characters and abstract objects trivially exist. The real, interesting question is about their grounding. This shift in focus from existence to fundamentality has been the dominant trend in metaphysics for the past twenty years or so.

**the problem with the standard story**

Here's the problem. It places the neo-Carnapians and the neo-Aristotelians in a position where they seem to agree on a key point: that debates focused solely on existence are often trivial. From the neo-Aristotelian perspective, this makes them look like the next logical step. In this view, the neo-Carnapians performed a useful, but purely *negative*, task by showing the flaws in the neo-Quinean focus on existence. With that groundwork laid, the neo-Aristotelians can then step in to offer a *positive* new project, turning the page on the neo-Quine-Carnap debate and building something new around concepts like grounding and fundamentality.

As a result of this framing, the standard story tends to sideline the neo-Carnapians. This isn't to say they're completely ignored, of course; people like Sider, Schaffer, and Bennett certainly take them seriously. Rather, the problem is that the standard story implies the neo-Carnapian critique is *only* about existence. And if that's the case, then the neo-Aristotelians, with their new focus, can safely disregard it. 

But this is surely not the case. The neo-Carnapian argument, on a high level, is about semantic variance. Therefore, it applies to any theory as long as the theory allows semantic variance.

Let's return to the question I framed at the start: How much reality should we read off our language?

For the neo-Quineans, the answer is *sometimes-ism*. We need to paraphrase our ordinary language and scientific theories. While the exact rules for this paraphrasing are messy, but idea is to create a language that maximizes pragmatic virtues like simplicity, elegance, and explanatory power. It is from this idealized, paraphrased language that we are meant to read off reality.

For the neo-Carnapians, the most plausible response is *always-ism*: we can always read reality off our language because the resulting beliefs are true. This is because, if a sentence $S$ is true within an interpretation $I$, then it is correct to believe that $S$ under the guise of $I$.

This "under the guise of" is motivated by the distinction between propositions and facts. (What I mean by 'proposition' here is the objects of our beliefs, and what I mean by 'fact' is the thing in the world that makes a sentence true.) For example, "Superman can fly" and "Clark Kent can fly" are the same fact, but they are different propositions: one might believe the former but not the latter. One way to explain this is to say that someone believes of $x$ under the guise of 'Superman', that $x$ can fly, while not believing $x$ under the guise of 'Clark Kent' that $x$ can fly.

By the same token, neo-Carnapians suggest we can see different linguistic frameworks as different "guises" for understanding the world. Since many alternative languages can serve as equally good guises, there are many different ways to structure our knowledge of reality. Each of these guises constitutes genuine, true knowledge. This move allows neo-Carnapians to embrace a form of realism, distancing themselves from the anti-realist never-ism.

---
But in fact this question is not totally accurate. It's better to ask, How much reality should we read off our *interpretation* of language? We aren't exactly reading reality off our language, as least as long as we take the model-theoretic meaning of "language" and contrast it with its interpretation. For example, syntactically speaking, there's no difference between banks. (For the sake of the argument, let's assume all kinds to be worldly.) Then if we are reading reality off our syntax, then we should take bank to be a unified kind. But normally we don't think so. We think "bank" is ambiguous and there are two different kinds of bank in the world instead of one. Therefore, our normal practice is to read reality off our interpretation of language, not the language per se.

Technically speaking, the interpretation of a language is a model. But as long as we are talking about the interpretation of natural language, the model-theoretic talk is best understood as either a reconstruction or a representation of our interpretation. I take it to be obvious that no one really think in terms of domains, predicate interpretations and variant assignments when we speak.

---

Intended conclusion: our interpretation is our disposition.

What I mean by metaphysical deflationism (I will simply use the term "deflationism" for the rest of the paper for a shorthand for metaphysical deflationism) : ==all metaphysical problems are merely a matter of what we mean when we use our language.== Doing metaphysics is nothing more than conceptual (reverse) engineering ==Thomasson Rethinking Metaphysics==. It is usually related to a bunch of notorious positions, like anti-realism, relativism or maybe even idealism. Indeed, the consequence of a thorough deflationism is utterly insane: Eventually we can't say how the world REALLY is. All we can say is something true relative to a conceptual scheme. 

But how can everything be a matter of language? We do metaphysics because we want to reveal some deep, objective facts about our world, not to reveal the way we use our languages. We want to know how the world is like, not how we talk about our world. It can't be the case that all we can talk about is how to use our language, not about the world. To say this is to destroy metaphysics for good.

But deflationary arguments are powerful. It simply relies on an innocent motivation that all languages needs interpretation. We can't say anything meaningful unless we attribute meaning to sentences. And it is also an innocent fact that we can use our languages in different ways, attribute meaning to sentences differently.

(What i want to say: for any "absolute" truth, we can always find an equivalent conceptual scheme that destroy the absoluteness. And given that we can agree with the alternative conceptual scheme, there seems nothing bad about it. The move is to say one conceptual scheme is more privileged, but it is not clear to see how)

What's the problem/puzzling feature about deflationism? What's at stake? Pursuit for objectivity. Just like we can talk about fictional characters in in some sense exist, but they don't 'really exist'. What REALLY exists? What REALLY is real? ==Fine 2009== Fine argued for a "Real" operator.

What is deflationism? QV: Alternative language, 

## On formalism, or truth by convention

We have an intuition that quarks, leptons, and bosons are the most basic components of our world, and they are more fundamental than chairs and tables. More importantly, we want to say this is an objective feature of the world. 

Any theory, as long as it is theorized, no matter how "deep" the theory is, it will become just a manipulation of symbols. And as long as it becomes a manipulation of symbols, there's no deep fact about which group of symbols is privileged. For example, for propositional logic, we usually have $\neg , \land , \lor , \rightarrow$, but we can pick $\neg$ and any one of the $\land, \lor, \rightarrow$ we can define the rest. For example, if we pick $\{\neg, \land\}$ as primitive, then we can define $A \lor B$ as $\neg (\neg A \land \neg B)$, and $A \rightarrow B$ as $\neg (A \land \neg B)$. And we can similarly do the same if we take $\{\neg, \lor\}$ and $\{\neg, \rightarrow \}$. But should we say $\neg$ is necessarily somehow more primitive than others? But we can also introduce $\uparrow, \downarrow$ (NAND and NOR). We can define $A \uparrow B$ in terms of $\neg (A \land B)$, and $A \downarrow B$ in terms of $\neg (A \lor B)$. But we can take them to be primitive and define all $\neg , \land , \lor , \rightarrow$ with either of them:

|                   | taking $\uparrow$ as primitive           | taking $\downarrow$ as primitive                                             |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\neg A$          | $A \uparrow A$                           | $A \downarrow A$                                                             |
| $A \land B$       | $(A \uparrow B) \uparrow (A \uparrow B)$ | $(A \downarrow A) \downarrow (B \downarrow B)$                               |
| $A \lor B$        | $(A \uparrow A) \uparrow (B \uparrow B)$ | $(A \downarrow B) \downarrow (A \downarrow B)$                               |
| $A \rightarrow B$ | $A \uparrow (B \uparrow B)$              | $((A \downarrow A) \downarrow B) \downarrow ((A \downarrow A) \downarrow B)$ |

In other words, $\{\uparrow\}, \{\downarrow\}, \{\neg,\land\},\{\neg,\lor\},\{\neg,\rightarrow\}$ are equally good primitive vocabulary for propositional logic. In fact we can construct infinitely many candidates for primitive vocabulary (There are only 16 definable 2-place logical connectives available, but we don't have to constrain ourselves to 2-place connectives. For example, the 3-place NAND, i.e. $\uparrow_{3}(A,B,C) \leftrightarrow \neg (A \land B \land C)$ is also complete). But they yield very different results about fundamentality (==some citation about logical grounds==). For example, if we take $\uparrow$ to be primitive, then the fact that $A \uparrow B$ seems more fundamental then the fact that $\neg (A \land B)$, which is an abbreviation for $((A \uparrow B) \uparrow (A \uparrow B)) \uparrow ((A \uparrow B) \uparrow (A \uparrow B))$ (even according to Dorr's citeria -- ==some discussion about granulity of facts needs to be discussed here==). But if we take $\{\neg,\land\}$ as primitive, then the fact that $\neg (A \land B)$ is just the fact that $A \uparrow B$ because $A \uparrow B$ is just an abbreviation of $\neg (A \land B)$.

Should we then any one of them is somehow privileged? And parsimony couldn't help pick out the "one true logic" here, because $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ are both complete. It's also hard to see if any of them is somehow more natural. Is material implication more natural than disjunction, or disjunction is more natural than material implication? It seems there is no way out for this. If we accept there's no privileged "absolutely most fundamental" set of connectives, then for any formal system that is stronger than propositional logic, there are some cases of fundamentality being a relative matter.

## On Grounding

The standard explanation of grounding is talking about "in virtue of", and "because". But as ==xxx== points out, it cannot just be the explanatory relation, for explanatory relation is context relative and subjective. But "grounding" are intended to be worldly. If we are to understand it as some sort of "objective explanation", then it would be very strange. It's like talking about an omelette and intend it to be egg-free. (Unionists) We must be separatists. But if explanatory relation is separate from grounding relation, then we shouldn't start our examples, intuition and formalization from the talk of "in virtue of". For example, a red apple backs the experience of a red apple. But we shouldn't try to formalize the pure logic of red apples from the experience of apples. There's no guarantee that we can find the right kind of worldly feature in these instances. ==say more about this==

Bennett's formulation is better: it's about building. And in some sense we can admit that building is more of an objective relation. But eventually Bennett succumbed to the talk of "in virtue of" -- by succumbing to this talk, Bennett admit she leans towards deflationism: the "in virtue of" is merely a convention and there's no absolute, deeper truth about it. See P59 for further problem, this claim needs much detailed discussion. In fact Bennett explicitly tried to not use the term explanation (P61), and instead used the word "generative". But she cannot dodge it.

Explanation is in the realm of rationality, therefore it is easy to do philosophy that violates sanity.

## On Metametaphysics

For the context, let me briefly sketch the familiar story of the development of contemporary metaphysics (The story has been told in ==schaffer what grounds what==. I am merely sketching it). 

I will use "neo-Quinean", "neo-Carnapian" and "neo-Aristotelian" as some sort of broad label.

For "neo-Quinean", I mean metaphysicians who think metaphysics as a discipline for questions about existence. 

Quine's view: to find out what there is
Lewis' extension: Modal operator is just disguised quantifier over worlds, and existence of possible worlds determine the truth of de dicto modality. And de re modality is determined by counterparts, which in turn is determined by similarity.

For "neo-Carnapian", I mean metaphysicians who think at least some metaphysical debates are in fact talking past each other because they are using language differently.

Neo-Carnapians: deflating questions about existence

Hirsch's thesis: verbal dispute about two bi-interpretive language, some existence questions are not substantial.
Thomasson's thesis: easy ontology, we can get easy answers for ontological questions.

Neo-Aristotelians: 

Existence questions are trivial, the more important question is about fundamentality. (citation from "rethinking metaphysics: Neo-Aristotelians are tried of neo-Carnapians and neo-Quineans.") Even if we get a list of indispensable existence, it seems we still miss out some important fact about our reality. So we can move forward our metaphysics because the old way of inquiry missed out something important. And since neo-Carnapian are targeting at neo-Quineans, then we can also ignore the neo-Carnapians.

Problem: are Neo-Aristotelians really escaping the attack from Neo-Carnapians? The gist of the Neo-Carnapian theory is not really about existence only, but all possible semantic variance of terms. Their argument should not only apply to existential ones. So the question is, are Neo-Aristotelians immune to neo-Carnapian deflationism?

Three ways of talking about fundamentality. Neo-Quineans, by inheriting the legacy of Lewis, talks about fundamentality in terms of naturalness and structure.

Naturalness (Target: Ted sider and Goodman's riddle)
(small-)grounding/building (Target: Bennett)
Essence (Target: Kit Fine Essence and modality) closely related. Singleton Socrates. The incorrectness of singleton Socrates example. We think Socrates is somewhat internal to $\{Socrates\}$, while $\{Socrates\}$ is somehow external to Socrates. But why set formulation must have this interpretation of being external? Partly the reason comes from syntax. If we write $\{\}-Socrates$, I am afraid the intuition for would change.



The only reason I can think of


## On theory choice

Why we need to care about theory choice? All we need to do is to determine which theory is correct. To talk about choosing theory in metaphysics risk conflating metaphysics with epistemology. I am pretty willing to believe that there is one true reality, and therefore *in some sense* there is "the one true metaphysics" independent of any epistemic argument. 

But the pressure comes from radical skepticism. What if everything happens because there is a god doing all the push and pulls to make it look like it has laws of nature? What if we are having a realistic dream about the reality? In other words, these kind of skepticism points to the possiblity that, we do not have the ability to fix the "one true metaphysics". Given all what we can get (including any philosophical argument or any possible empirical evidence), there are in principle no way to rule out radical skepticism.

In contemporary metaphysics, metaphysicians usually dismiss radical skepticism as being crazy (e.g. Yablo: "but that's radical skepticism"). I believe that's correct, but it does reveal something. To reject radical skepticism, most often we appeal to rationality. For example, we may say we are We can't do metaphysics without epistemology

I don't see any metaphysical account per se can rule out these kinds of possibility. 

## On Modal Logic

According to two-dimensional semantics, some sentence could be a priori contingent. A sentence is a priori when it is 2D-valid, i.e. no matter which world the speaker of the utterance is in, the utterance is guaranteed to be true in that world. A sentence is (superficially) contingent if no matter which world the speaker is in, the utterance is possible to be evaluated as false, and possible to be evaluated as true by people in other worlds. For example, the sentence "The length of the standard meter bar is the actual length of standard meter bar" is a priori because no matter which world this sentence is uttered, this sentence is true in that world. But if we evaluate this sentence in worlds other than the speaker's world, then it is possible to be false because "the actual length of standard meter bar" refers to 1-m-length in the speaker's world, while "the length of the standard meter bar" refers to 1-m-length in the evaluation world.

A posteriori necessity is stranger. A sentence is a posteriori when it is not 2D-valid, i.e. it is not guaranteed that, no matter which world the speaker of the utterance is in, the utterance is guaranteed to be true in that world. But in what sense, then,  is a sentence still necessary when it is not 2D-valid? We invoke the concept of "realistic model": an a posteriori necessary sentence is valid in any realistic model. For example, "the actual morning star is the actual evening star" ('morning star' and 'evening star' taken as rigid descriptions) is a posteriori necessary because for any realistic model, the sentence is true whereever the speaker is, and whichever the possible world it is evaluated. (Of course it is better to revise the sentences into, "if the actual morning star uniquely exists, then the actual morning star is the actual evening star")

## On Sanity

rationality: practical rationality and epistemic rationality

rational agency is required by rational agency

Argue from two sides:

Epistemic norm: 

Are beliefs truth-tracking? But if there's any epistemic norm, then belief beyond doubt

Pragmatic virtue: to choose a theory presupposes rational agency

Why rational agency, or the ability to make choices an decision? Hirsch's answer: assume there is a language that use rational* instead of rational. Then it follows that, it is more rational* to be rational* than to be rational; and it is more rational to be rational than to be rational*. 

This should not be taken as a trivial claim that, "rational" could mean something else, like hello.


The problem with this answer is to asume the normative power we attribute to our language did not change.

"trust the reality"

My reason against "truth-trackingness": 

What is the thing being tracked? In normal cases, we track truth by empirical evidence. We can know it's raining when you see raindrops falling down. So we say this evidence gives reason for believing that it's raining. But the problem is why this must tracks the fact that "it's raining", instead of "someone is playing a video that it is raining by the window" (because this evidence does not distinguish between these two cases). 

I understand that radical skepticism is somewhat a taboo in contemporary analytic philosophy. But for the sake of the argument let's put the worry that I am running into radical skepticism aside for now. 

The Bayesian principle for initial distribution of credence can in some sense solve the problem: our initial distribution for the credence for "it's raining" is higher than "someone is playing a video that it is raining by the window". But does this initial distribution track the truth? It doesn't. But if we say we cannot rationally believe "it is raining" when I look at the window and the raindrops are falling, then I don't know how to live a normal life.

**If you throw away all the intuitions, you cannot establish anything**

We always assume everyone has the same intuition, same disposition and, in some sense, the same form of life. But it is almost certain that it is not the case. We have subtle different intuitions and forms of life. Maybe not so radically different, so that even people in the opposite of the globe wouldn't interpret "plus" as "quus". And maybe there might be some biological reasons. But what if there are aliens (or artificial intelligence) who are radically different from us?



- **The principle of sanity**: For someone who is capable of philosophical reflection, it is impossible to genuinely believe oneself to not be a rational agent.

**Clarification for this principle**: This principle also applies to acceptance (i.e. It is impossible for someone to accept oneself to not be a rational agent), but I will focus on belief in the rest of the paper unless specified otherwise.

Here, "philosophical reflection" roughly refers to activities such as examining and revising one's beliefs, analyzing arguments, and choosing between competing theories. The condition "for a person capable of philosophical reflection" is to rule out certain aberrant counterexamples. For instance, someone who has been so thoroughly brainwashed that their only possible belief is "I am not a rational agent" would not qualify as a counterexample. I assume all readers who have already made it here have already satisfied this constraint.

The precise meaning of "rational agency" is, of course, highly controversial and open to multiple interpretations. Consequently, this principle will have different variants depending on how one chooses to define the term. However, I contend that the *principle of sanity* is plausible under most, if not all, of these interpretations.

For now, I will start by adopting a minimal account of rational agency as *epistemic agency*. What I mean by "epistemic agency" here is not the kind of agency resisted by doxastic involuntarists. According to doxastic involuntarists, *direct* voluntary control over belief is not possible for us. But here, I use "epistemic agency" to refer to any sort of agential control over our beliefs, no matter how indirect. For example, we have the ability to choose to re-examine our beliefs and investigate new evidence. Doxastic involuntarists, like Hieronymi 2008, also acknowledge that we possess this kind of indirect control. Therefore, it is uncontroversial that we have epistemic agency in the relevant sense.

**Reason for this principle**: This is more or less an axiom in this paper that I take to be self-evident. But I will still try to give some defense. First, implicitly, this is already a widely accepted principle. 

Aristotle appears to adopt this principle in Chapter 9 of _De Interpretatione_. There, he rejects the principle of bivalence due to our deliberation and action. He argues that, because deliberation and action obviously requires the future to be open, propositions about the future cannot have a pre-determined truth value. Therefore the principle of bivalence is false. However, Aristotle's argument seems to epistemic instead of metaphysical. When he writes that "what will be has an origin both in deliberation and in action" (19a6-9), the most plausible interpretation is that our *beliefs* about the future originate from these rational activities, not the future state of affairs itself. If so, his argument is best understood as follows: it is impossible for us to genuinely *believe* that the future is predetermined while simultaneously viewing ourselves as rational agents who deliberate. Therefore, by *the principle of sanity*, we must reject the principle of bivalence.

There are also more contemporary cases.People seems to reject epiphenomenalism largely due to the reason that, it's insane to say we do not have any sort of mental causation. And I will argue later that, the motivation of a widely held metasemantics principle, *the Principle of Charity*, actually comes from of a stronger version of *the Principle of Sanity*. Therefore, in fact people have been implicitly using this principle.

Nonetheless, I will also try to sketch a direct defense. If the principle were false, then it would be possible for a creature to engage in philosophical reflection without believing itself to have rational agency. But philosophical reflection inherently requires making inferences and utilizing abstract concepts. Let's assume, as is widely held, that such complex thought requires language (or some language-like mentalese). Then, using language for this purpose necessitates rational agency.

To use language requires intentionality. For example, a dinosaur that accidentally scratches the shape of the symbol "water" into the ground is not using language, because it does not use the symbol intentionally to represent something. Therefore, intentionality is necessary for language use. But to use representation intentionally for philosophical reflection is just to exercise the very sort of indirect, agential control over one's beliefs by potentially revising what one holds to be true. And we must be able, at least to some extent, to be aware of our own intentions. Thus, if we use language to engage in philosophical reflection, we must be aware of our epistemic agency.

I do not take this to be an invincible argument. Perhaps with some heavy argument, one may claim we can build a "philosophy machine" that can reflect on arguments and produce a philosophy paper while being completely non-agential. However, I believe it is quite obvious that rejecting the principle of sanity, plainly, is to be insane. Even if such a "philosophy machine" is possible, I still think no person should reject this principle, simply because we should not be insane. ==In other words, I am in fact suggesting two different principles. The stronger version is what I explicitly laid down and inclined to stand with. But even if one somehow resisted it, my conclusion can still be established by the weaker version, i.e. if we are capable of philosophical reflection, then we should not believe we are not rational  agents.==

There are obvious consequence for adopting this principle. Together with the following innocent principle that:

- **Ought Implies Can**: If it is impossible for us to believe that P, then it is not the case that we ought to believe that P.

It follows that *the Principle of Sanity* is incompatible with the traditional account of rationality: A belief is rational iff the reason to believe is truth-tracking. This is because the principle of sanity commits us to a belief we must hold (that we are rational agents), regardless of the evidence. Assume our epistemic norm is to hold only true beliefs, and scientists tell us that rational agency is just an illusion, then we would be obligated to believe that we are not rational agents. But according to the principle that *Ought Implies Can*, there is no such obligation.

Then immediately, one might object that if epistemic norms must be truth-tracking, then we should rationally reject *the Principle of Sanity* itself. However, what does it mean to "rationally reject" a principle? If doing so is an act of philosophical reflection, then, as argued earlier, the very act requires us to presuppose our own epistemic agency. Therefore, any attempt to "rationally reject" *the Principle of Sanity* is self-defeating, as the act of rejection presupposes the very rational agency the principle commands us to accept.

There is also an auxiliary argument that help me establish the metaphysical argument that I want to establish. According to the neo-Quinean view on metametaphysics, choosing between empirically-equivalent theories is a matter of comparing their pragmatic virtues. And usually, they were considering theoretic simplicity, elegance, etc. But what how could these pragmatic virtues more valuable than our rational agency? 

## On Charity

Calling it rational doesn't make it automatically rational.

## On Agency and causation

The difference between causal and non-causal building is about manipulating variables in the foreground or the background.
