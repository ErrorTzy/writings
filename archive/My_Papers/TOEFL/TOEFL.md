Elephants have several surprising  behaviors. The reading mentions three of them and offers each an interpretation. However, the professor casts doubt on each of these interpretations.
First, old elephants depart from their herds and die alone near bodies of water. Given this, the reading suggests that elephants are aware of their death. In contrast, the professor points out an alternative reason for this phenomenon. Old elephants' teeth are usually worn, so they tend to eat softer vegetation. Softer vegetation grows near water. Therefore, old elephants head to bodies of water not because they want to die there. Rather, they happen to die there when they are eating.
Second, elephants can be tought to paint. According to the reading, this shows that elephants are artistic. The professor, however, disagrees. The elephant trainers repeatedly reward elephants when they paint the right patterns of lines, and punish them for wrong patterns of lines. Therefore, elephants may as well have no idea what these lines represent. They just know they should repeating some specific patterns of lines.
Third, elephants back away from mice and avoid them. The reading interpret this as elephants' fear of mice. The professor also thinks this interpretation does not hold. Elephants back away from mice only because they are not familiar with them. And it is a natural reaction for animals to back away from things they are not familiar with. For those elephants that live in places where mice occur frequently, they are not afraid of them. Therefore, there is no reason to say elephants are afraid of mice.
