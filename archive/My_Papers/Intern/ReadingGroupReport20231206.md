**Real estate model:** 

- China: no holding cost
- UK: very high

**Football model:**

- UK: supported by domestic and global fans by broadcasting tickets and surroundings (?)

# How does parenting influence mental age of Chinese children


> \textcolor{red}{comment}
> 
> I believe the main issue here now is about "mental age". It has a very specific meaning in psychology. According to APA psychology dictionary, mental age is:
> 
> *A numerical scale unit derived by dividing an individual’s results in an intelligence test by the average score for other people of the same age. Thus, a 4-year-old child who scored 150 on an iq test would have a mental age of 6 (the age-appropriate average score is 100; therefore, MA = (150/100) x 4 = 6). The MA measure of performance is not effective beyond the age of 14.* [@vandenbosAPADictionaryPsychology2006]
> 
> Notice that "*The MA measure of performance is not effective beyond the age of 14*". If the author insist in using the concept of "mental age" and want to expand his research on children more than 14, he should do a MUCH deeper research on how to measure mental age. He can start with "age, mental" entry in The Cambridge Dictionary of Psychology [@matsumotoCambridgeDictionaryPsychology2009]. It introduced how the concept of mental age came into being.
> 
> Alternatively, the author can use the concept like "mental health", "academic ability", "social skills" to specify what exactly he wants to dig into. Also, the author can do his research on the base of parent's perspective and look into what parents should and should not do to their children. If he is interested in discussing this, he can start from reading Becoming Parents https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parenthood/\#BeinPare in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

**What areas of research will you cover**

1. Teenager mental activities/ages
2. Parenting experiences/elements
3. Theories about parent's common issue
4. The impact parenting on teenagers' mental age
5. The other aspects that may influence teenager's mental age
6. Future problems caused by unequal mental age and the way to fix it

> \textcolor{red}{comment}
> 
> It's okay that currently there are too many aspects to study. But a proper academic research paper should focus on ONE question and focus on it. The current research area is far too discursive and way too huge for a 5000 words paper. It must eventually be trimmed and organized in clear lines of reasoning. The author needs to make sure he will not in the end simply juxtapose a bunch of random information that only seems relevant but has no logical connection.

**How will parenting influence children:** @chase-lansdaleLongTermEffectsParental1995

- Parental divorce has a moderate long-term negative impact on adult mental health (measured by Malaise Inventory total score), controlling for economic status, children's emotional problems, and school performance preceding marital dissolution.

**How to measure the mental age of a children:** @hobsonMentalAgeWorkable1948

> 
> This paper argues that young children who do not meet the age requirement of kindergarten and Grade I admission actually perform well in later study and thus schools should open doors to them. This paper DID NOT speak anything about how to test anyone's mental age. 
> 
> In addition, the mental age test it mentioned is used to determine whether the children is intellectually mature enough so that one can handle his accelerated study in kindergarten and grade I. Though I have not looked into this test itself, it is highly suspicious whether this is applicable to other ages.

# The impact of irrational consumption factors from the young generation on the economy in modern China

> \textcolor{red}{comment}
> 
> Currently the key issue for this research is that:
> 
> 1. the notion of "irrational consumption" needs to be clarified. It's way too broad to analyze the factors. To the best of my knowledge, irrational consumption, when used in its positive sense[^1], is within the domain of behavioral economics or sociology. Therefore, I believe it would be better if it establish the theoretical basis for the research on these subjects.
> 2. the economy in modern China is also, a bit broad, though it might be feasible. It depends on great can "irrational consumption" affect Chinese economy. I think in what range can the solution be effective should be determined *during* this research. If it turns out that the "irrational consumption" is a rather minor factor in the overall economic growth, we can still says that it is a good way to boost local economy and alleviate inequality.

> This paper below proves that China is encountering a headwind in economic growth, which is logically relevant to the research. Following this way of thinking, I believe there may be two strategies for this paper. If this paper is to be purely economical, then

@songDeepeningReformOpeningup2019

three surges

- opening policy, 1970s
- taxation reform, 1994
- WTO, 2001

slowing since 2010

## what is the cause that slows down the growth? 

### East Asian model: the key factor in opening-up

feature: openness to trade and investment

the driver of growth: economic structural change from agricultural sector to manufacturing and service sectors --> productivity from rural to urban

bottleneck: technology, main cause of China's total factor productivity (TFP) in recent years

### Aging Population 

the drop of labor supply --> the drop of labor intensive production --> move from labor-intensive manufacturing to innovation

aging --> decline in saving rate --> downward pressure on domestic investment and current account surplus

### (In the short run) Demand side factors

subdued investment and net export growth --> slow GDP growth

## What could be the new source for economic growth?

- institutional reform --> integrated more closely into global markets and prevent deglobalization
- open-up of goods, capital and labor markets
- education and reduction in poverty to alleviate inequality

[^1]: When I say the "positive sense of irrational consumption", I intend to oppose it to the negative sense that we criticize. This is usually caused by false advertising or recommendation algorithm, and we need to legislate to prevent people from getting too much involvement. However, when I mean it in positive sense, it means a kind of economic phenomena that cannot be easily explained by traditional models. This is because traditional models presume that people are rational decision makers and follow several principles (i.e. game theory, marginal effect) when they consume. However, it is hard to find explanations for some phenomena, like fans economy. Thus we must appeal to social science, psychology, etc.. I call these these phenomena "irrational consumption in positive sense".
