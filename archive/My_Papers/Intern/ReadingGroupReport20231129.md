# 1. The impact of irrational consumption factors from the young generation on the economy in modern China

> A better title could be something like “How does Chinese consumers' irrational consumption affect the economy in modern China?”
> econ paper
> 
> **Comment**:
> What is the purpose of this paper? To explain historical events about irrational consumption (theoretical interest), or to find solutions for the young generation in China (practical interest)? It is not entirely clear why the analysis of how young generation affect Chinese economy should include any historical events. 
> 
> If the purpose lies in the former, then it would be sufficient to dig into the Tulip Mania and Wall Street Crash, though it may require deeper theoretical understanding of the subject matter. 
> 
> If it lies in the latter, it is not directly clear how to draw the solutions from the current analysis. Or the author can try to prove that Chinese economy is declining BECAUSE of the irrational consumption of the young. (though this seems intuitively hard to prove)

## 1.1 historical evolution of irrational consumption

the term is coined by American economist in 1915: People are affected by physiology, culture, social and other factors

Tulip Mania in Holland 17th century
Wall Street Crash of 1929

> pronunciation issue:
> 
> desire vs. desirrr
> urge vs. urGer
> mania vs. mornia

## 1.2 systematic analysis of influencing factors of irrational consumption

1. social fashion and trends
2. emotion-driven (adj?)
3. advertising and marketing
4. lack of financial knowledge

## 1.3 The impact of a rational purchasing decision on the national economies

> why this is not mentioned?

# 2. The genetic and psychological reasons that affects people's performance on sports

> bio or psych paper?
> 
> **Comment**:
> (again) What is the purpose of this paper? The current structure leads to two very different implementation. Knowing genetic reasons are helpful for selecting potential athletes, while psychological reasons explain how coaches should treat their athletes. In addition, the "innate factors" part seems tautological and hard to see its use. 
> 
> I understand that the author wants to make her paper sound solid and thus has explained tremendous amount of biological facts. But if her intention is to say that there are other factors APART FROM these facts, like the psychological ones, she should focus on the latter.

## 2.1 genetic reason

> reason**s** 

## 2.2 psychological reason

there are very few papers on this topic

- The nerve system
- The music you listened
- The distress feeling
- The sleep state

## 2.3 innate factors

> why genetic reasons do not count as innate factors?

- innate disease
- size of the skeleton

# 3. How does parenting influence mental age of Chinese children

> **Comment**:
> The author currently only has an instinct that parenting does have influence on children, and his instinct is backed up by some papers. But it is completely not clear what does the author want to say in his paper. In my perspective, if "mental age" means how someone is politically or ethically mature, then it would be interesting (but also very hard) to discuss the how people understand parenting affect politics. Or, it would also be very interesting to criticize the modern trend of "liberalist" parents and try to use the resource, like Aristotle, to justify the traditional mode (the "authoritative" parent) of parenting.

# 4. Social Media

> ethics?
> 
> **Comment**:
> Currently there are too many topics under this title. The author should narrow down to a specific one.
> 
> Fake news and fraud is not an issue exclusive to social media because they had came into being long before social media was born. If the author wants to choose this topic, then it would be better to talk about whether (or under what condition) should the govenernment/media company to limit the freedom of speech on SNS? (which would be philosophical and I am very interested in this topic)
> 
> I am not familiar with the second topic, but SEP's entry of [*Social Networking and Ethics*](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-social-networking/#FriVirGooLifSocNetSer) provides a great summary on the related discussion. (and I am also interested)
> 
> I am not sure how to understand the last topic. I think it can be reduced to the second one. 

## 4.1 Fact vs. fiction

pro: early stage-tools for connection and sharing 
con: cannot discern fact and fiction

1. fraud
2. fake news

## 4.2 Social relationship

form relationship and gain better understanding of diverse perspectives, but that relationship may be superficial and fake

## 4.3 Communication

Rise of social media revolutionized the way we communicated with others

# 5. Gender Fairness

> education? political philosophy?
> 
> **Comment**:
> (yet again) What is the purpose of this paper? Is it aiming at discussing social justice or gender equality (theoretical interest, which I have a great interest in), or revealing hidden instances of gender equality or/and promoting solutions (practical interest)? 
> 
> If the author intends to discuss social justice, then he should realize that gender bias is only one of the issues that belongs to social bias. For example, we believe northern Chinese are extroverts and the southern ones introverts, and the elderly are wiser than the younger generation. Therefore, we may prefer to hire northerners as salesperson, and the older ones as politicians, which also creates unequal opportunities. 
> 
> If the author plan to explore the meaning of "gender equality", then he should not take ANY theory of equality for granted. Such concept as "equality" is highly controversial and any specific understanding of it needs to be justified by arguments. For example, when he mentioned "fairness vs. equality", he actually addressed the difference between the 'equality' within the contexts of communitarianism(not communism!) and libertarianism. He can have a look on SEP's entry of [equality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equality/).
> 
> Nevertheless, if the author have to arbitrarily accept one specific understanding of equality, he can draw his attention on statistics and prove that some solutions are helpful for gender equality.

# 6. The music impact on cognitive development

> bio
> 
> **Comment**:
> This is a hard-core science research and I have not much to say. But my instinct is that different genres of music may have different impact on our minds. I think this research can be more helpful and interesting if it concludes something like "death rock can boost our language abilities while classical music makes mathematicians".

## 6.1 memory

## 6.2 mathematical abilities

## 6.3 language

## 6.4 emotional intelligence


# 7. Sports and economy

> econ
> 
> I believe the author wants to say something like this:
> 
> 1. The UK and South Korea commercialized their football industry, and both their football team and economy are improved. $(((Cu \supset (Eu \bullet Fu)) \bullet (Cs \supset (Es \bullet Fs)))$
> 2. Therefore, if x commercialize their football industry, both both x's football team and economy are improved. $\therefore (Cx \supset (Ex \bullet Fx))$
> 3. Therefore, If China commercialize their football industry, both Chinese football team and economy are improved. $\therefore (Cc \supset (Ec \bullet Fc))$
> 
> This current structure, as I understood, is feasible. However, the author should be cautious in proving (1) and (2). He should prove that, for example, the UK's and South Korean football team only improved AFTER they commercialized their football industry. And he should clear out counterexamples, if any. For example, there may be some countries who commercialized their football but their football or economy are NOT improved. (This would require a clear definition of what does the term "football commercialization" exactly mean) He must also prove the commercialization that UK or South Korea has taken is transplantable for China.

politicians uses sports to develop economy
UK and South Korea

Chinese football is unsuccessful because it is not commercialized
