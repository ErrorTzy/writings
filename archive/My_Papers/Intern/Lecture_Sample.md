Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Schools (universities, colleges, and high schools) should teach students about specific careers and jobs instead of general subjects.

First, through learning a great variety of subjects, students can acquire general
knowledge across a wide range of fields. For example, I am not obsessed with all compulsory subjects, but I cherish the value of comprehensive education and study chemistry, biology, and physics diligently.

Hence, accumulating general knowledge is part of a well-rounded education for students, even if it is not essential for job hunting.

结构： $((a \supset b) \bullet (Aa \bullet Bb)) \rightarrow (x)(Ax \supset Bx)$ ???
