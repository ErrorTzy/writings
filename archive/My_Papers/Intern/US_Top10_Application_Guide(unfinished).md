# Introduction
This paper aims to serve as a guide for undergraduate applications who want to get into a top US university. It examines 26 successful applicants who gained admission to renowned institutions including Stanford, Princeton, Columbia, UChicago, UPenn, Duke, John Hopkins, Northwestern, Dartmouth and Brown.[^1] 
I will start with an analysis of the 26 cases. Then I will try to devise a "portrait" with chronological advice.

# Cases

## Standardized Test

Among the 26 successful applicants, 18 disclosed their SAT scores, with two providing old SAT scores. The 16 new SAT samples showed an average score of 1544.69, ranging from 1490 to 1580. Of these 26 applicants, 10 also reported their TOEFL scores, averaging at 113.90, ranging from 110 to 119. Additionally, 10 of the 26 applicants indicated taking multiple AP courses, with an average of 4.2 courses taken. The range for these courses was from 2 to a maximum of 10 courses. Another 2 among the 26 reported to have taken IB course, one of which has gained 39-41 points, and another "almost full mark".

## Background

Out of the 26 successful applicants, 25 provided adequate information detailing their backgrounds. Generally speaking, their background activities all have very clear leitmotivs, and usually two.

Among to their own account, only 9 individuals mentioned that they possess a focus in either STEM or Art & Humanities, but did not mention both.[^2] Within this subset, 8 out of 9 exhibit a robust concentration in Art or Humanities: 3 in history, 2 in philosophy, 2 in sociology, and 1 in art. Meanwhile, only 1 individual demonstrates a strong, singular background in biology. It is also worth noticing that 4 out of this 9 students are from US high school, which is rather a high proportion since they contributes to half of the students from US high schools in the 26 samples.

On the other hand, there appears to be a noticeable pattern among those with a "mixed background." Individuals with strong STEM foundations (evidenced by competition wins, high-level research involvement, or exceptional grades in SAT2, AP, and/or summer programs) often supplement this with AP courses in humanities or excel in art, particularly music. Conversely, those with strong art or humanities backgrounds (often involving substantial research in pioneer programs or summer schools, accompanied by professor-referenced letters or active engagement in left-wing social activities with relevant research) also display competence in STEM, usually in math and physics.

Summer school programs are important resources to get reference from University professors, and embark on serious academic researches. 12 out of 26 mentioned their summer school experience. The distribution across universities stands as follows: 4 from Stanford University, 2 from Columbia University, 2 from the University of Chicago and 1 each from Yale, CMU, UPenn, JHU and Duke. There is only 1 student out of 26 clarified that he have never attended a summer school program. This student, however, did his research with a professor on sociology in pioneer program.

No one included AMC, MUN in their application and only 1 mentioned CTB, though about 4-5 students said they have participated in these activities.

## Major

16 out of the 26 also disclosed their intended majors. 4 applicants applied for Sociology, among whom 1 indicated a double major with physics. Computer science was chosen by 3 students, one of whom is pursuing a double major integrating literature. 2 applicants applied for art. Another 2 chose public policy, one of whom double majored economics. Additionally, there were 2 applicants each for history and philosophy. Finally, a single applicant specified chemistry. It is striking that, despite economy or public media being probably the most popular choice among Chinese students, only 1 student among the 16 planned to study economy.
