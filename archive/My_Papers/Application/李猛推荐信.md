To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to provide a reference for Tang Zongyuan. I have had the pleasure of knowing Tang during the spring semester of 2023 when he actively participated in my reading group focused on Jean Bodin's "The Six Books Of The Commonwealth". Throughout the course of our reading, I have come to recognize Tang as a dedicated and diligent student with proper academic qualities for study in philosophy.

I have known Tang for the duration of one semester, which allowed me to closely observe his commitment to academic excellence and passion for philosophy. He exhibited a solid and mature capacity to grapple with complex ideas and arguments, as demonstrated by his active participation in discussions and his ability to clarify arguments from Bodin's maze-like writing.

Tang undertook the role of gathering and editing relevant literature for our reading group. He is able to independently locate Bodin's allusions or responses in many historical thoughts, effectively retrieve the original texts, and provide an analysis of the dispute. This showcases his strong ability to gather materials and produce independent research. ( He even shows his masterful programming skills to scrap the text and reorganize them into a more readable format.)

In addition, although without a philosophy background, Tang consistently demonstrated his wide and accurate understanding of ancient Greek philosophy, which greatly enriched our discussions on the historical context of Bodin's work. 

What sets Tang apart is his unrelenting motivation to study philosophy. His enthusiasm for the subject matter is palpable, and it is evident that he approaches philosophy with a genuine and sincere desire to explore many fundamental questions. His passion, assiduous self-learning, along with his aptitude and sharp instinct, have equipped him with the ability to conduct proper philosophical research.

In conclusion, Tang possesses exceptional qualities should make him an outstanding student in philosophy. His ability to independently gather and analyze literature, his capacity to engage with intricate philosophical texts, and his profound understanding of ancient philosophy reflect his dedication and promise as a future philosophy student. I am confident that Tang will continue to excel in their academic pursuits and make valuable contributions to the field of philosophy.

If you have any further questions or require additional information about Tang, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Professor LiMeng
