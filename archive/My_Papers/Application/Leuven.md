# Introduction (1-6)

What does an active life consist of? Labor, work and action

> Do Arendt assume politics has no telos?

## active life is necessary, but not articulated (1-3)

1.
active life is necessary for all men
contemplation depends on active life

2.
labor, work and action are similar from the viewpoint of contemplative life because they disturb contemplative life.

> What does Arendt think about the relationship between contemplation life and active life? Do active life need contemplation?  

3.
The Greeks founded the tradition of contemplation over action; 
the Christian tradition did not change it because they think the order of human faculties are established by truth from revelation.

## criticism on Marx (4-6)

4.
Marx's (and Nietzsche's) reevaluation only reversed the order, but did not change the conceptual framework.

5.
pre-Socratic: action, work, labor
classic: work, action (politics is to produce ==everlasting peace== for contemplation), labor

6.
Marx: labor(productive labor) = work, action(the art of producing history)
The only difference between Marx and classic order: contemplation is now meaningless (the order is unchanged).

> why the product is everlasting???

# Arendt's distinction (7-33)

There is such a distinction:

7.
There is a distinction between work and labor.
Locke's casual remark: labor of our body and work of our hands

8.
etymological evidence: Greek, Latin, French, German
labor: ==bodily experience==, pang of birth



## What is labor? (9-14)

### meaning (9-10)

9.
labor is the metabolism between man and nature (produces the vital necessities that must be fed into the life process of the body)
life is rectilinear in decaying, but life process is circular
work ends when the object is finished
labor ends when life ends

10.
laboring and consuming follow each other so closely that they almost constitute one and the same movement.
labor is out of necessity
Marx wants to emancipate man from labor
this emancipation is only possible through technology (from necessity), not political emancipation (from convention)
?? ==consumption is also laborious==

### productivity (11-12)

unproductivity
11.
goods for consumption is soon absorbed and cannot heaped up like Lockes' property.

> Why it must not be heaped up and immediately consumed? The processes is repetitive does not follow that the goods are not lasting. Fridge is exactly for storing what is produced by labor. Man can be emancipated through himself, i.e. if he is living in Antarctica where food won't go bad.

productivity
12.
though labor seems futile, it is productive. 
A few man can be liberated from labor by enslaving because man (slaves) can produce what is more than his own need. (Which follows that either man is able to produce more, or the nature is able provide more)

### happiness (13-14)

13.
realest happiness comes from labor
laboring is the part of human that is natural

14.
the repetitiveness provides us short contentment, and the grief or sorrow will also hardly born


## What is work? (15-26)

### durability and objectivity (15-18)

15.
constitutes the stable and solid world we live in
not consumed (absorbed) but used

16.
though destruction is not avoidable, the product of work remains in the world no matter you use it or not.

17.
the product of work to some extent does not subject to change, thus 
objectivity comes from man-made artifice, not the indifference of nature.
Only then can we look upon nature as something objective.

18.
fabrication reifies nature by removing it from natural location, and reification leads to durability and objectivity
Homo faber becomes the lord and master of nature

### end model and tools (19-22)

19.
the process of making is determined by the categories of means and end
fabrication comes to its end when reach the end and fabrication is a means to produce its end.
fabrication and usage are two different kinds of process
fabrication is repeatable (multiplication), but not necessarily repetitive

20.
have a definite beginning and end is the mark of fabrication
fabrication is reversible when one destroys the product
which proves that man is the master of himself and his doing

> fabrication = the work of homo faber
> fabrication, then reification
> reification, then durability
> durability, then objectivity
> 
> fabrication, then definite beginning and end
> if definite beginning and end, man is the master of its creation
> fabrication, then man is able to destroy the product
> if fabrication is reversible, man is the master of its destruction
> therefore, man is the master of fabrication

21.
tools in labor: lightens and mechanize labor (subjective needs)
tools in fabrication: designed for fabrication (objective aims)
the movement dominates labor. machines are best suited --> labor: body obeys machine; work: machine obeys hand

22.
if something has end, then it provides justification and organize and judges them

### perplexity (23-26)

23.
everything is a mean, then it face the perplexity: it will never arrive at something that has use in itself, and if nothing can be useful in itself, than all things cannot be justified as useful.

24.
Kant's solution is to make man is the ultimate end. The problem of this solution is that it degrades all ends to mere means.

> Why would they lose their own meaning? what is the consequence of losing their own value?

25.
If we wake the viewpoint of fabrication, then the value is use, but what is the use of use?

26.
art is useless but most durable

## What is action? (27-33)

27.
action is founded on the solid world built by work, but it surpasses it and gives the second birth of non-biological life by beginning something new.
Through action, one distinguish oneself from otherness and become unique among the plurality of man.

### speech and story

28.
man disclose who he is by speech, though this disclosure is unknown to himself
action is dependent on its author

29.
action starts a new process in the web of human relationships, which makes it unpredictable
action always produce stories where nobody is the author if it (?), and it does not tell the story of the maker, but the hero
the meaning of life reveals itself through the stories, which makes history a big story
since a story does not have maker, it is not made

> in fact not make = don't need maker? the purpose will almost never fulfilled = no purpose?

### unpredictability and reversibility (30-31)

30.
since the boundlessness of the web is inescapable, one's action is not predictable and thus cannot be limited by a framework.

31.
actions are not reversible because the consequence has been made

### promise and forgiveness (32-33)

32.
forgiving undo the deeds, or we will become the victims if the consequences forever
promise stabilizes the future, or we will never achieve the identity which produce the "person" and caught in his ever-changing mood

> Does this solution presupposes nothing?


### freedom

33.
natural life span bring everything to destruction, while man, though they must die, are not born in order to die but to begin something new;
action creates man and brings freedom into being.
