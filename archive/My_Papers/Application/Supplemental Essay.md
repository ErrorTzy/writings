My educational journey in the realm of ancient Greek philosophy has profoundly influenced my perspective on values such as inclusivity and justice. Ancient Greek philosophy, with its central focus on the examination of one's life and the cultivation of virtue in the soul, has left an indelible mark on my beliefs.

One of the philosophers I have delved into extensively is Plato, renowned for his profound discussions on justice in 'The Republic.' Plato's teachings underscore the idea that the purpose of higher education extends beyond the boundaries of gender or any other external factors. Instead, it is about the profound nurturing of the human soul. The human soul transcends the distinctions of ethnicity, gender, and race, and it possesses the potential for greatness. (Though Karl Popper criticized Plato for being an enemy for an open society, I believe it is unfair and at least Platonism can be understood differently, in opposition to Popper.) Therefore, I firmly believe that higher education should be a beacon of inclusivity and justice. It should be a realm where every human soul is recognized for its inherent potential and is provided with the nurturing environment it needs to flourish. In this light, the values of inclusivity and justice should be at the very core of higher education.
