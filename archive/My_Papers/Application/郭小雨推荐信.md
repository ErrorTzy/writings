Over the years, he has audited multiple courses of mine, including "Introduction to Political Philosophy" in the fall of 2021, 2022, and 2023, and "Research in the History of Political Thought" in the fall of 2022. Moreover, we both participated in Professor Li Meng's reading group on Bodin's "The Six Books of the Commonwealth" in the spring of 2023. This extended period of interaction has provided me with ample opportunities to observe his academic growth and intellectual development.
