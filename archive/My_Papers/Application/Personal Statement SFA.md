Before engaging in any rational account, I wish to explain the route that has brought me, a Japanese major student, to philosophy MA and thereby explaining my motivation and concern (as well as my GPA). The route may be a bit intricate, so please bear with me.

Back in high school, due to my excellence in these subjects, I secured admission to two universities in China: Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), one of the top four universities and especially known for its excellence in STEM fields, and Shanghai International Studies University (SISU), which I applied to only as a safety net, thanks to the “Baosong” system. In 2019, the Ministry of Education modified the admission policy for the “Baosong” system, allowing students to apply to multiple universities. However, SJTU’s admission office failed to update its policy and subsequently revoked my admission because I was reported to have applied to SISU.

This unexpected turn left me with no choice but to reluctantly and despairingly enroll at SISU, where I found myself placed in the Japanese major, the major I had absolutely no interest in. To make matters worse, I had zero knowledge in Japan or the Japanese language. However SISU has the best Japanese language major in China, which has attracted many students who have been studying Japanese for YEARS. Some of them had even passed the N1 (the highest level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test) before entering college. (Also, the undergraduate education at SISU almost solely focused on language ability. Therefore, my GPA has no relevance in indicating how I will perform in philosophy.)

I had never experienced such downfall before. I had been a top student in one of the best high schools, but I was going to a much less prestigious university than I should have, and struggling to achieve even average academic performance in a major which I believed to be meaningless, no matter how hard I tried! My despair led me to attempt suicide, but the police prevented that from happening. Since then, a question has haunted my mind: “Is there a reason for me to live, rather than to die?”

Over the years, I found that it is only possible to gain the ability and tools to think about the answer by studying philosophy or to say, taking philosophy as a way of life. During the process, I have become emotionally stable, and the question shifted from an emotional need to a theoretical curiosity. Moreover, the question transformed into many different forms: How and why should one live? What is a good life? Is moral truth even possible?… . There are some very different solutions to these questions, especially from Aristotle, Kant, Nietzsche, and analytical philosophy. I am highly motivated to embark on this exciting journey of exploration.

Enough for the story. Now I shall begin my rational account of my academic background, interest, and intention for the program.

I have studied ancient Greek and German, and engaged with books, courses and reading groups to develop my understanding of philosophy. I audited “Introduction to Political Philosophy” for three semesters, and participated in several reading groups, including one, led by my ancient Greek professor, dedicated to reading through all Platonic dialogues, and another focused on Bodin, organized by the philosophy department at Peking University. Furthermore, I followed syllabi or recorded online courses at various universities (thanks to COVID-19). Over the years, apart from secondary literature, I have read

- Plato’s _Republic_, _Timaeus_, _Meno_, _Theages_, _Apology_, _Cleitophon_, and _Gorgias_,
- Aristotle’s _Nicomachean Ethics_ and _Politics_,
- Rousseau’s _first and second discourse_, _Emile_ and _The Social Contract_,
- Locke’s _Two Treatises on Government, Book II_,
- Bodin’s _Six Books on Commonwealth, Book I_,
- Kant’s _Critique of Pure Reason_ and _Critique of Practical Reason_,
- Nietzsche’s _On the Genealogy of Morality_,
- Nishita Kitaro’s _An Inquiry into the Good, Chap. I and II_ and _Basho_,
- Harry Gensler’s _Introduction to Logic, Chap. 1-12_,
- Michael Welbourne’s _Knowledge_,
- Brian Garrett’s _What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?_,
- excerpts from David Chalmers’ _Philosophy of Mind_, and
- Peter Adamson’s _Philosophy in the Islamic World_, Part I.

With these, I have started to understand how to converse with historical texts by reconstructing arguments, evaluating them, and putting them into a broader intellectual debate. Also, I have especially paid close attention to Plato and explored the relationship between Plato and Nishita Kitaro’s metaphysics in my Bachelor thesis. 

While my (almost) formal training primarily focuses on the history of philosophy, this is due to the absence of other philosophy courses at SISU. The formal training in the history of philosophy is the only option available to me. Nevertheless, I do not wish to trap myself to the history of philosophy. Therefore, I have taken online courses and studied textbooks on topics such as logic, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics independently.

My ultimate concern is ethical, but I also have a particular interest in logic, epistemology, and metaphysics. Regarding the history of philosophy, I have a great interest in Aristotle and Plato, but I am open to other philosophers. Additionally, I have a curiosity in the philosophy of science due to my previous interest in science subjects. In the short term, my chief intension is to explore more about ethics, epistemology and political philosophy, as well as develop a general foundation and training in philosophy. In particular, "ought to" usually cannot be derived from "is," but Plato's epistemology derives knowledge of virtue and justice, especially, through the craft analogy. I wish to understand how it works and whether it is valid.

I am extremely eager to pursue further studies at Bristol. 

In conclusion, I would be extremely honored to be accepted by Bristol, and I believe I am well-prepared for my study at Bristol, both academically and personally.
