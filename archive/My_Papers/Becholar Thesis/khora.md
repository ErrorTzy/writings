Opening:
myth vs. logos: The logic of myth is ambiguous

*neither being nor becoming* or *either being or becoming*
neither nor: not form, not perceptible

not legitimate logos, but a bastard logos, or "as in a dream", which implies divination.

| BEING | DISCOURSE |
|:---|---|
| being | through logos|
| becoming | through mythos |
| receptacle | through both? neither?|
Is there anything to think according to necessity?

I
How can we know about receptacle?
- A clarification on such style of question: Is this a good question? Why from *genres of being* to *types of discourse*?
1. It is different to separate the two problematics because the quality of discourse depend of the quality of the object.
2. It is authorized by passing through genre(??)

Is the way of discourse different from or equal to the logos/mythos?
- different from: a triton genos
- equal to: the sexual type: "mother" and "nurse"
The interpretation of equal to: built upon the distinction upon the sensible and the intelligible, which is the distinction no longer get along with khora(???)
khora is not situated but situating the residence of khora
It gives place to oppositions, it would itself not submit to any reversal.

Why use khora instead of translation?(P93)
Any kind of translation is a tropology that will be led astray by retrospective projection

a dispelling of misunderstanding: We could never propose the exact word, nor to name it by rhetoric, nor finally to approach itself because it is outside of any point of view.

All we need to do is to show the **structure**, not the **essence** of which khora have none, which makes tropology and anachronism inevitable

The mistake of the whole history of interpretation: 
Will the presumption of such an teleology order inevitably produce something like khora? (???)
It is a mistake that the interpreters give form to the meaning of khora from all the marks to which we say it is exposed, because khora can only offer itself by removing any determination

It is vain to analysis the schematic mark that Plato's discourse provide, because khora itself will never be touched

The khora can only be declared via the anthropomorphic schemas of the verb "to receive" and the verb "to give".
