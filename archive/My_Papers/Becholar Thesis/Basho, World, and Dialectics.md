 # Lead-in
What is one’s place in the midst of others, the topos or locale one occupies within the environment and how does one fit into the changing and ever-so-uncertain cosmos, whose confines keep receding into the abysmal dark?

## The attempts on solving the problem of epistemological dualism and ontological substantialism:
Bergson: philosophy of pure duration
Husserl: phenomenology
Hegel: dialectic
James: subjective experience per se
Nishida: Basho
- Taking off from the neo-Kantians' attempt to logically found the dynamic of cognition without reference to psychological contingencies.
- the logical foundation for his ideas(論理化); "the relationship between the logical and consciousness" (取り残されたる意識の問題)
- Solving the problem of self-awareness which is not to be conceived psychologically for itself is the standpoint that establishes psychological awareness.
- Nishida moves away from a thing-centered view of reality by focusing on the predicate qua universal as the environing or enveloping determinant wherein the grammatical subject qua individual is implaced and determined.

### 場所
- a response to subject-object dualism
- Basho is understood as the **concrete situation**, i.e. "placedness" or "implacement" of our lived experience vis-à-vis reality, that grounds cognition and whence the bifurcation into subject-object derives.
- we fell from grace in **thinking** about the situatedness of "always ready(immer schon)"
- still have the problem of intuitionism

### 働くものから見るものへ
- broadened "Intuition" from its earlier meaning as but one moment in the dynamic of the absolute will's self-mirroring self-awareness to a "seeing everything that is and everything that is at work as reflections of what mirrors itself within itself by itself becoming nothing".
- from a voluntarism that relies on the postulation of an absolute will to an intuitionism belonging to the self-mirroring of that which recedes into nothing
- "seeing without there being a seer"
- the deepest self-awareness lies at the point where the self-contradiction of existence is made explicit, at the very place (basho) where life meets death.

### 論理と生命
- developed into the historical world wherein we **interact and work upon one another** as well as upon things.
- **a connection** between what we ordinarily call “logic” in its restricted formal sense  and the dynamic structure of the world
- the "peri-logical"(包論理的) structure of implacement envelops and grounds the more restricted structure of dichotomies.


### 取り残されたる意識の問題

- the failure of Greek philosophy to attribute any “logical independence” to its notion of “place” (chōra in Plato, and its interpretation as hyle in Aristotle)
- turns attention to the neo-Kantians,  who inherited Kant’s notion of a “transcendental logic” in order to claim for  their epistemology a “logic” that transcends the psychological.

# Hylomorphic Dualism
#### Kant and neo-Kantians: 
- They understood the subject-object relation in Greek hylomorphic terms(going back to Plato) of form and matter, determining and determined. They viewed cognition to be the **construction of the object by means of a priori conditions**. 
- The neo-Kantians also developed this hylomorphic dualism in terms of the distinction between ideal and real, validity (values like "truth" that serve as norms or standards for judgment-making) and existence (belongs to the reality of the sensible matter of judgment, the grammatical subject of the judgement), ought and is. **In short, validity and being are distinct: a being "is"(Seiendes ist), values "are valid"(Werte gelten).**
#### 西田幾多郎:
- Inherited the dichotomy and focus upon its characteristic distinction between none-being and being. On this he superimposes other dualities such as the Husserlian noesis-noema, and the judicative (grammatical) predicate-subject distinction, understanding all of them as indicating the duality of **determining act and determined content** while viewing this in terms of being and non-being. Nishida's aim was to show an underlying dynamism that sustains as well as erases such dichotomization through a development of his earlier notion of self-awareness in terms of his new concept of Basho.
#### Core issue: The reference of the matter of cognition to something transcendent to its determination.
- 西田幾多郎's Refutation on Rickert: Failing to clarify the ground of the given content that would establish objective knowledge (in 早田博士に答える). If the objective source of the material of cognition transcends the very process to begin with, the thing-in itself remains unknown. 
( #Q what does "transcendent" here mean?)
- 西田幾多郎's solution: rather than viewing form and matter in cognition as two separate entities, he sought on the basis of his notion of a self-mirroring self awareness to regard the formation of the unformed mater, the objectification process, from the broader perspective of a **self-forming formlessness to thus encompass the dichotomized terms of subject-object or form-matter**.
( #Q how do he wrap that up by logical deduction? how is it not constructed? Is this just a mere construction that doesn't lead to any concrete difference on Kant's philosophy?)

### The issue of object-centered thinking: determining and determined
- Aristotle: takes this "substance" (ουσία) to be that which serves as the grammatical subject or substratum (ὑποκείμενον) but is never itself predicated of something else. It cannot be a predicate. The primary substance in its own individuality independent of its predicates, underlying but transcending them, is hence unknowable, irreducible.
- neo-Kantian: Succeeded Aristotle's substantialism and caused problem: If substance is transcendent to our knowing and judging acts, how does it come to be the object our knowledge and the subject of our judgment?
- another issue: taking subject as something objectified. Even Husserl took consciousness as something that is conscious of(i.e. an object thematized) rather than a consciousness that is conscious(i.e. an act). Therefore, **phenomenology had failed to pay attention to the very consciousness that is conscious of that consciousness**( #Q how is it possible not to objectify anything when discussing it???)
- Nishida believes that we posses some sort of immediate knowledge of the unobjectifiable prior to any thematization. To explain this, he looks away from the grammatical subject to the the opposite direction: the determining "predicate".

# Solution to hylomorphic dualism: 場所
#### 述語面:
- Allows for acts constitutive of objects to be seen in light of reflective acts, which in turn presuppose the "述語面".
- The reason why its related to predicate is that in a subsumptive form of judgment, the subject is the particular one(特殊者), and the predicate is the universal one(一般者)
	- Bosanquet: When we that "this desk is made of oak", the true grammatical subject is not "this desk" but rather reality. 
		- Nishida's interpretation: the entire underlying situation as a whole 
- 「置いてあるもの」と「置いてある場所」: the subject is enveloped by the predicate, whereas the copulative *is* signifies implacement
	- E.g. "red is a color", "red" is implaced within the broader universal "color"
	- and then for "the rose is red", "the red of the rose" is implaced within "red"
- therefore,  everything that is (あるもの), whether physical or mental, is implaced (置いてある) in some place (場所).
- the universal's own individuation: a self-determining act, its self-individualization into that particular.（ #C where does that predicate come from) 
- Nishida characterizes basho as a "concrete universal"(具体的一般者). This concrete universal is a determining act that is self-determing, a pure act.
- there must be presupposed a transcendent predicate-plane as the final and the unobjectifiable predicate that cannot become a grammatical subject, which is "**nothing**"(無) (the thing outside **consciousness**)
> #Q 
> 1. is this deduction valid? the predicate-plain presuppose the form of subsumptive judgment, which means that only those who can be involved in subsumptive judgment can have such property, whereas Nishida deducted that there is something that cannot be a grammatical subject, which does not fit in the subsumptive judgment in the first place.

#### 2 ways to nothing:
1. Consciousness can not be a subject, therefore nothing can implace consciousness. This nothing is a "oppositional nothing"
2. The relation between consciousness and being indicates that the self-awared consciousness is a being, which supposed to be enveloped by a predicate. However we can not find such predicate, which leaves this predicate "absolute nothing".
Two understanding of nothingness:
- the thing that is beyond experience and encompasses the opposition of 
being and nothing.
- the thing that is opposed to beings, which is still determinate, a being.


#### being-nothing structure:
- for "red is a color", color, as a universal, makes room in oder to include opposites belonging to the same species.
- the ultimate subject is the individual being, while the ultimate predicate is "nothing", which is transcendent.
> here it shows the definition of transcendent: not being able to be form a knowledge.　The fundamental understanding about nothing is "non-self"
- The reciprocity: the universal's inverse determination (逆限定)and the inverse correspondence (逆対応) between absolute and relative, place and implaced.

#### The oppositionless object
##### A bridge from neo-Kantians: Emil Lask
- The dichotomized terms of fact and value, being and validity, sensible matter and logical form are already interfused in their giveness to experience, in a unity constituting meaning prior to judgment. (Die Logik der Philosophie). We live in truth because we live through categories as in contexts.
##### Difference
- Nishida also refers to an intelligible world of values or validities, as providing horizontal guidance for the acts of consciousness. In distinction from the natural realm of objects, this would be the realm making possible "the emotive interpenetration between mutually intuiting persons".
> does this alludes the potentiality of self?

#### Topos and chora
- topos: it is translated to topos.
- chora in Timaeus: In the beginning of Basho, Nishida claims that he drew inspiration for his idea from Plato's concept of chora. chora appears as the **receptacle** in the onto which the ideas are informed or inscribed to make their particular copies. But the character Timaeus explains that while it always receives things, “it has never in any way . . . taken on any form like any of those things that enter it . . . for its nature is to be a matrix for all things”
- Basho is the positive source of the real that invert nothing into beings, which separates it from chora (a mere receptacle) and thus collapsed the dichotomy between form(idea) and matter(chora)

Nāgārjuna’s notion of the emptiness


subject is finitized by predicate, while predicate is reflected by subject

#### The Basho System
- What appear as substances are constituted by acts of force within the basho og beings. 
> the perspective of knowledge itself, seeing as substantial things.
- but seen from a more concrete standpoint, they are constituted as oppositional objects by acts of **consciousness** upon the field  of consciousness.
> the perspective of relative nothingness, the reflection by consciousness on knowledge, seeing as substanceless acts of consciousness.

- That field of consciousness however is still a being, whose acts are in turn determined by the will in relation to intelligibles upon the basho of the true nothing.
> the perspective of absolute nothing, seeing things as a part of nothingness, seeing as images or shadows of the true nothing. thus the action of congnition became the intuitive seeing

- Seeing is the way to conceive contradictions.

#### Contradiction and generation-and-extinction

- Contradiction is not only logical but also existential.
- buddist term of "消滅"矛盾的統一
