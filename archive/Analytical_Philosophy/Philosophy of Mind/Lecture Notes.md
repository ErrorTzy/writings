# 1 Context
## 1.1 Intellectual Context:
Give a consistent account of all of reality, to fit in the mental part from the fundamental science.

## 1.2 Historical Context: Cartesian dualism

### 1.2.1 Two kinds of things in the universe:
Mental substance called minds (or the soul)
1. essence of mind: thinking
2. Minds are indivisible and hence indestructible
3. Minds are free
4. We have direct knowledge of our own mind and we can not be mistaken

Physical substance called bodies (or the matter)
1. essence of body: extension
2. Bodies are infinitely divisible
3. Bodies are determined by the law of physics
4. We have indirect knowledge of bodies

### 1.2.2 The Problem of Cartesian Dualism
#### 1.2.2.1 The Mind Body Problem
What is the relation of Mind and body?
The causal relation between the mind and the body
e.g. A hammer hits my thumb; Raising arm.

Descartes' solution: mind and body are connect by pineal gland.


How can a physical transaction affect the soul, and vice versa?

##### 1.2.2.1.1 Epiphenomenalism
physical world is causally closed, and mind do not have any impact on physical world. Mind is like the froth on the wave or the light on the lake, which does not cause anything.



#### 1.2.2.2 The Problem of Other Minds
How do I know that you have a mind?

Descartes' solution: some kind of argument of analogy, but it's poorly constructed

The argument of analogy
1. Me: physical event -> mental event -> physical event
2. Others: physical event -> ? -> physical event
3. By analogy, there is a mental event in between

The Analogy argument does not work, because 
1. I feel pain when I bang my own thumb with a hammer but when I bang others' thumb, it don't, therefore you cannot make the analogy.
2. There has to be some non-inferential way to test the validity, but how do I check this inference is valid in this case?

#### 1.2.2.3 Solipsism
My mental states are the only mental states that exists

Interesting asymmetry about solipsism:
If someone else holds solipsism, it will be instantly refuted by me, 
while my own solipsism is not refutable

Extreme solipsism
Nobody has any mental states except me

Weaker solipsism
We can never know if others have mental states

Still Weaker solipsism
Other people do exist and do have mental states but we can never be sure that they are like ours
from this: Seeing Red problem:
If there is a section of people who the experience of seeing red other people would call it seeing green, how do we tell?

#### 1.2.2.4 Skepticism in general (theories about perception)
How do we know anything about the world other than the content of our mind: perception:

Descartes' solution: God would otherwise be deceiving me if there is no physical realm
Problem with Descartes' solution: How would any error possible?
Descartes' further solution: our will exceeds our understanding

##### 1.2.2.4.1 (Naive) Realism about perception
When you perceive, you really see perceive the object itself

Refutation:
1. Argument from illusion
Naive realists cannot account for hallucinations
What you are perceiving is actually "sense datum(sg.)/data(pl.)"(what is given to sense)
Searle: I've never had a hallucination


2. Argument from science
We know from science that naive realism is false

The problem of the argument from science: homunculus fallacy
The thing being seen was the electric signals, but who's watching? If something is seeing the signal, then it will lead to infinite regress.
& Searle: what you see is not the signals but the object itself

Bertrand Russell
Science presupposes naive realism, but science refutes naive realism.
Therefore, naive realism is self-refuting

##### 1.2.2.4.2 Representative theory of perception/Representative realism
Descartes and Locke

##### 1.2.2.4.3 Phenomenalism/Idealism
Hume and Barkley
How can two things looks alike when one is invisible?
Why not retreat to native realism?
If you push one eye ball, then you will see twice as many things as you as used to see before, therefore according naive realism, everything doubled.

#### 1.2.2.5 Animals 
Do they too have an immortal soul?
When someone is hit by a car, his thigh won't feel the pain but his soul will, because material objects cannot feel.

Descartes' solution: “it seems reasonable to suppose that” animals do not have souls, because only soul have consciousness
Problem: So when a thumb hurts, the pain is not in the thumb but in the soul, but how? The ordinary understanding should be that, my body is like a ship and the mind is a pilot, and when the ship hurts, then the pilot doesn't hurt.
Descartes' solution: The soul is fused throughout the body.
Problem of this solution: Mind cannot be extended


#### 1.2.2.6 Sleep
If consciousness is the essence of mind, then what happen when we are asleep? 

Descartes' solution: We are still a bit conscious when we are asleep.
Problem:
REM: dream
but what about non-REM?

#### 1.2.2.7 Freewill
Our physical action is determined by physical law or mind? 

Descartes' solution: You can experience freewill, therefore it is just a fact.

Determinism:
Everything is determined by physical laws anteceding back to the big bang.
Challenge to determinism:
Quantum indeterminacy
Challenge to quantum indeterminacy:
Freewill is not randomness of making things happen, like my arm randomly goes up.


#### 1.2.2.8 Self and Personal Identity
If body is only contingent and the essence is solely about soul, then what if I have a different body?

Descartes' solution: there is a consistent soul


#### 1.2.2.9 Intentionality
How can mind be directed towards other things

#### 1.2.2.10 Unconsciousness
How can there be some mental state that is unconscious?

#### 1.2.2.11 The use of mental concept in explanation
why we do not have a hard science about sociology and history? These seems because it appeals to something mental. 


# 2. Modern theories

## 2.1 Dualism
We are psychological entities somehow live in physical world

### 2.1.1 substance dualism
Descartes, there are two types of substances

### 2.1.2 property dualism
20-21th century, soul is the property of a body
mental states cannot cause anything, physical world is causally closed (there is no cause outside of physical world)
--> Epiphenomenalism

## 2.2 Monism

### 2.2.1 Idealism
Berkeley, Everything is mental 
Plato, Berkeley, Hegel, Bradley, Josiah Royce

### 2.2.2 Materialism
There are only matters in the universe, **there are no irreducible mental phenomena**
How to make sense of psychological activity?

#### 2.2.2.1 behaviorism: 

earliest form
mind is just patterns of human behavior and dispositions

historical background: making psychology scientific, and the only observable phenomena are human behavior

##### 2.2.2.1.1 psychology/methodological behaviorism, behaviorism as a methodology

psychology is to study human behavior, it does not matter if there is a mental state behind behavior for scientific purposes

##### 2.2.2.1.2 logical/analytic behaviorism

stronger, feeling pain means one would behave as if he feels pain
=="He feels pain" and "He behaves as if he feels pain" are equivalent in meaning==
founded by John Watson, Skinner

##### 2.2.2.1.3 Objections

should we allow "possible behavior" to exist?
i.e. if it rains, then he brings umbrella
but isn't this belief itself a separate mental state?
response:
it can also be reduced to behavior, like asking a question

technical objection

circular:
presuppose the mind, because behavior have a desire

what are the specific conditions that one has to satisfy in order to display some mental state?

in common sense, we think the mental states as causing the behavior. 

sometimes people do not behave

a joke:
if publicly observable behavior are mental states, then other people should know your mental states better than you yourself.

Noam Chomsky attacking skinner's book verbal behavior:
physics consists of meter reading, but physics is not really a science of meter reading. it is actually confusing the evidence for the psychology with the psychology itself
-->
#### 2.2.2.2 physicalism:
mind is not behavior, but just the brain
=="He feels pain" and "He behaves as if he feels pain" just happens to be identical==
Problem: how can the brain behave?

identity theory: 
the brain is a digital computer
The mind-body relationship is the program-hardware relationship, the mental states are identical to physical states

###### 2.2.2.2.1.1 Type identity theory

For every type of mental state, it is identical to a type of physical state

1. Problem of identity:
the mental states have properties that physical states don't have and vice versa. However, according to Leibniz's Law, if two things are identical, 
they have same properties.
e.g. Mental states cannot be 8 millivolts, and physical states cannot be true or false, or pleasant or unpleasant.

Response: 
by using FMRI, we can locate where our thoughts are and how strong it is

Problem:
When my toe hurts, the pain is in my toe or in my brain?

Response:
the pain itself is in the toe, but the experience of having a pain in the toe is in the brain

2. Chauvinism Problem:
only animals that have neurons like ours can have mental states? Why couldn't computers have mental states? Why obsessed with neurons?

e.g. you and I all believe Denver is the capital of Colorado, but they might be encoded differently in our brains.

Response: abandon type-type identity and adopt token-token identity


3. Disguised Dualism
it is still property dualism because you have two different sets of properties
there are no such property as mental property

response: 
there is no mental phenomena; topic neutral description, does not need mental aspect to describe
e.g. "There's something going on with me which is like what goes on in me when I see an orange"

Problem with this response:
the fact we don't talk about something does not mean it does not exist, therefore this response is irrelevant

eliminative reduction and non-eliminative reduction
water is identical to H2O, but water exists
rainbows and sunsets don't really exist but only an illusion
> ?why

###### 2.2.2.2.1.2 Token identity theory
For every token of mental state, it is identical to a token of physical state.

Problem: 
if tokens are not even the same type, how can they be identical?

Response:
Functionalism(computer functionalism)
We identify our mental states in terms of causal relationships, vis. function: e.g. if one believes it rains and he have the desire to stay dry, then it causes him to carry an umbrella. 
belief is also caused by perception.
perception -caused-> x (a belief), x and y (a desire) -caused-> action
mental states are ==functional states== designed by causal relations

difference between functionalism and behaviorism
behaviorism: mental state IS behavior
functionalism: mental state is the CAUSE of behavior
