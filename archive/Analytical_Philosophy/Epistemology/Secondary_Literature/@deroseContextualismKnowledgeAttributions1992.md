# Part I: What is contextualism?

**Bank case A:** 
Friday: To deposit an unimportant paycheck
My wife: Maybe it won't open tommorow
Me: I was there two weeks ago, I know it will open

**Bank case B:**
Friday: To deposit an important paycheck that will bounce next monday
My wife: Maybe it won't open tommorow because bank may change their hours. 
Me: (I was there two weeks ago) I will go and make sure. I don't know it will open.

Assume that the bank will be open on Saturday:

(1) It is true that I know the bank will open in case A
(2) It is true that I do not know the bank will open in case B
(3) If it is true that I know the bank will open in case A, then it is true that I know the bank will open in case B
(4) If it is true that I know the bank will open in case A, then it is false that I do not know the bank will open in case B

## Contextualism

The contextualists can deny (4) while admitting (3) because the truth conditions of the sentences of the form "S knows that p" or "S does not know that p"  vary by context.

contextual difference between case A and case B:

1. the importance of being right: It is important for me to be right in case B.
2. the mentioning of possibility: My wife mentioned the possibility in case B. 
3. the consideration of possibility: I considered the possibility in case B.

## Invariantism

The invariantists deny the contextual factors and asserts (4). The invariantists includes:

1. skeptical invariantism: Deny (1). It is only useful for me to say that "I know" in case A, but it is false.
2. non-skeptical invariantism: Deny (2). I know in case B, but it would be misleading for me to say "I know" to my wife because she thought knowing should exclude the possiblity of changing the hour. However it is not a necessary condition for knowing.

## Purpose of this paper: respond to skepticism

skepticism:

1. we cannot have knowledge of absolute certainty
2. we cannot have ordinary claims ==(what's this?)==

Therefore, we (almost) never ascribe knowledge to any human beings.

Response: skepticism raises the semantic standards for knowledge in their context. But we can still claim that we know in relaxed context. Therefore, the skepticism is persuasive but meanwhile our ordinary claims are safeguarded.

## Why it is better theory?

The main competitor is skeptical invariantism, but it will lead to the conclusion that we can almost never achieve knowledge.
The contextualists also resist to deny (4).

# Part II: Difference between contextualism and relevant alternatives

relevant alternative (RA) theory: S know that p, iff. S is able to distinguish p from these relevant alternatives, and able to rule out these relevant alterbatives to p. 

problem: what makes an alternative a relavant alternative?

1. subject factors
eg. If there are a lot of such facades in the putitive knowers' vicinity, then the possibility that the person is seeing a facade is a relevant alternative.

> How the circumstance affect the requirement of knowledge? The external truth condition?

2. attributor factors
eg. If the speaker has just read about Decartes' devil, then the possibility that a devil is deceiving him is a relavant alternative.

> How a person undertsands "know"? The internal truth condition?

invariantist can be a RA theorist if he only accepts subject factors. In this case, he can reject (3), and admit (1) and (2).

> This version of invariantist seems to mean that the truth condition of p may be variable, but it should indiscriminately applies to anyone at a given time.

If the attributive factor affected the range of RA, i.e. if someone claims that he knows it is raining before he read Descartes, and he no longer knows afterwards, he does not contradicts himself.

If the subject factor affected the range of RA, i.e. if someone claims that he knows it is raining before he read Descartes, and he no longer knows afterwards, and there is actually a devil tricking him, then he contradicts himself.

**The subject factor** affect how good an epistemic position the putative knower actually is in. Thereby it does not affect the truth condition in first person's knowledge attribution but it changes the truth value. 

**The attributive factor** affect how good an epistemic posiiton the putative knowledge must be in to count as knowing. Thereby they affect the truth condition and the content or meaning of the attribution. 


The difference between contextualism and RA theory:

**RA theory**: the change in meaning is caused by the change of the range of relavant alternatives
**Contextualism**: the change in meaning is caused by the attributive factors.


# Part III: The Objections to Contextualism

"know" is an indexical word. When I am in a yellow room and said "this room is yellow", and then entered a blue room and says "this room is blue", my former claim does not contradicts the latter. 

"Does someone knows p" is not subject to contextual factors because from third person perspective it only affects the content of "know", not the truth value.
