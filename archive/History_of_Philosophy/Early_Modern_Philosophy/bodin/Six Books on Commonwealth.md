# Book 1
## Chap. 1: What the principal end is of a well ordered Commonwealth
## 1.1 Definition (1C)
a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">lawful</mark> government of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">many families</mark>, and of that which unto them <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">in common belongs</mark>, with a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">puissant[^1] sovereignty</mark>.
1. a lawful government
2. of many families
3. belongs to families in common
4. with puissant sovereignty

### 1.1.2 The character of the definition (1D)
1. omitted by others
2. First: behold the end (1.1.1 1-3)
3. Afterwards: the means to attain thereunto (1.1.1 4)

### 1.1.3 The problem with others (1D-E)
1. Having propounded themselves with some end yet cannot attain the end desired. 
2. Not knowing the end of the matter, hoping to attain thereunto.

#### The allegory of the archer
1. unskillful archer who missed the mark
2. shoots at random, wishing to hit the mark

## 1.2 A lawful or rightful government(1E)
1. Commonwealth is holy
2. Commonwealth excludes the assemblies of robbers and pirates.

### 1.2.1 On robbers and pirates
In all the following situations:
1. giving public faith more safety
2. making offensive or defensive to the league
3. denouncing or undertaking war
Robbers and pirates should still be excluded.

#### 1.2.1.1 Reasons
just and lawful enemies vs. people who ruin Commonwealth
> Why would people obey laws?

The robbers does not obeys the law, thus people should not obey the agreement the robbers made by the robbers.
> Is it appropriate for a man who obeys law stop doing so when they encounter someone who disobey law?

#### 1.2.1.2 Examples
1. kidnapping case (2F-G)
No wrong is done if ransom is not paid, but the law permit the one being kidnapped liberty, while if someone is taken by lawful enemy in accordance with national law, then he loses liberty.
2. pawn case (2G-H)
Two reasons to return the robber's pawn:
- the robber submitted himself to the magistrate, thereby deserving justice
- in hatred of him which would unconscionably detain the sacred thing left to his trust.
> The sacredness of property, or the sacredness of trust?
3. Augustus the Emperor (2H)
Augustus proclaimed that he would give 10 sesterces to whoever brings Coracotas, the leader of the thieves and outlaws in Spain, to him, and Coracotas presented himself and demand the reward, which Augustus indeed paid to him although he could just executed him.
#### 1.2.1.3 Bodin's comment 
This opened a dangerous gap to all vagabonds to join robbers and thieves.

It is not impossible to make a goof prince/king of a robber, and there has been some, while some rulers conducted robberies and cruelties. (2K)

Examples:
> Pirates can be turned good? Then is revenge not needed?
1. Demetrius the pirate (2K-3A)
Demetrius blamed his father of teaching him only piracy, which moved Alexander, and Alexander thereby made him general. 
2. Solyman the great Sultan of the Turks (3A)
He made famous pirates his admirals and commanders at Sea.

**Bodin's comment:**
by drawing pirates to good order, the pirates are:
1. commendable without invading other states, but also 
2. by their means to ruin other pirates.

The society of the pirates
live in friendship and have great equality to divide the spoil (:the loot?)

the equality of parting the spoil =/= lawful division
the difference: wanting right government according to the laws of nature.

> Why is a government so important? Or the important part is the laws of nature? Is Plato's republic a society of robbers?

## 1.3 Ancient Definition(3B-4H)
*Commonwealths are societies of men assembled to live <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">well</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">happily</mark> together*

#### 1.3.1 Bodin's comment(3C-4F)
1. Does not stand because it does not exclude the society of robbers, and
2. having on part too much whereas in the other too little.

Wanting in description:
1. three principal things: family, sovereignty, commonwealth
2. joy was considered not necessary

The ancient logic:
- If joy is necessary, then virtue should have no prize, which follows that a commonwealth may be right well governed and yet nevertheless afflicted with poverty, forsaken of friends, besieged by enemies and overwhelmed with many calamities. (e.g. Marseils is fallen while a prosperous commonwealth can be full of vice)
- The most capital enemy of virtue: perpetual success, as if they are contrary in nature.


### 1.3.2 The Felicity of a man(4H-8F)
The ancient kind of approach declined from the best or the most perfect state of a commonwealth, whose end is indeed is better or heaven-like, but this is only imaginary without substance. (e.g. Plato, Sir Thomas More)
Instead, his approach is to **follow the best laws and rules of the most flourishing cities and commonwealths**, (because one is responsible to make effort to create a prosperous commonwealth), and although it is not necessary that as long as one follows the best laws then it will be prosperous, he will not be blamed for it (e.g. good pilot driven out of his course by force of tempest, or a good physician overcame by the force of malady).
> The responsible for prosperity vs. the best life?


- If 
	- the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">felicity of a city and a man</mark> are the same, and 
	- the chief <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">good of both</mark> are to the mind, and 
	- are only conversant in contemplation (as the wise one affirmed), 
- then it follows that 
	- the people enjoys true felicity to the almighty God and great Prince of nature by exercising themselves in the sweet knowledge of things natural, human and divine.

#### 1.3.2.1 Men of affairs and princes(4G-4H)
1. Every man measures his good by the foot of his pleasures and contentment
2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">a good man = a good citizen</mark>? the felicity of one man = the felicity of a whole commonwealth?

> the good of man and city (did not mention here)
> good man and good citizen
> the felicity of man and city

#### 1.3.2.2 Most men(4H)
man is base if he is only directed to necessity and not also pleasure and ornament

> necessity vs. one's own pleasure, supporting men of affairs

#### 1.3.2.3 Wise men(4I-4K)
1. The measure of right and wrong, of truth and falsehood
2. An inflexible rule
3. Thought to excel all others in justice and wisdom

the felicity of one man and of a whole commonwealth are one
a good man and a good citizen are one

felicity is measured by the most beautiful and sweet contemplation of high matters

Examples:
Aristotle
sometimes following the vulgar opinion, seems doubtful in thinking it necessary to virtuous actions to join also wealth and power, yet his reasons are placing the chief good an felicity of man in contemplation.

Marcus Varro
felicity of man consists in a mixture of action and contemplation together.

#### 1.3.2.4 Bodin's comment(4K-5B)
the felicity of simple thing is therefore simple, while felicity of compound thing is thereby compound.

1. Goodness of the body: health, strength, agility, comeliness and beauty
2. Goodness of the mind: obedience of desire to reason, or in the action of moral virtues
3. Goodness of the understanding and mind itself: intellectual virtue: wisdom, knowledge and true religion
	1. wisdom: concerning world affairs, sees the difference between good and evil
	2. knowledge: concerning the searching out of the secrets in nature, sees the difference between truth and falsehood
	3. religion: the knowledge of things divine, sees the difference between holiness and impiety
	altogether contains what is desired and what is to be fled from; unlosable, self-sufficent to make man happy

This applies to not only individual but also to a commonwealth, because a city will be more blessed and fortunate with virtue if accomplished necessities.

### 1.3.3 A blessed and fortunate city (5B-8F)
1. What are necessary: sufficient territory and place capable for the inhabitants; a fertile place to plant in, with beats and cattle, and for the maintenance of their health, …
2. What are profitable: medicines, metals for tools and arms
3. Things for delights and pleasures


#### 1.3.3.1 Comparing the chief good man with commonwealth (5C-6I)

Allegory of raising a child

A man:
1. First
	1. getting all things needful for him to lead a safe and happy life
	2. well by nature
	3. better by education instructed, abhor the wicked man and make friend with the good.
2. Afterwards
	1. beholds changes and chances of the world
	2. behold the unsteadiness and diversity of human manners, ages and conditions
	3. beholds mutations, rising and downfalls of commonwealths
	4. joining things past to those that are to come
3. After that
	1. turning to the beauty of nature
	2. the wonderful order and consent of causes whereby the lowest are joined to the highest
	3. the beginning, returning and end of everything
	4. what in things is mortal and transitory, and what immortal and eternal
4. By little and little
	1. contemplation to the heaven, wonders at the heavenly bodies
	2. the sweet harmony of the world and its every part
	3. a perpetual desire to see the cause of all things and then carried on until be brought to the God, the first cause and the governor of all the world.
	4. search further and seeing that he is an infinite and incomprehensible essence, greatness, power, wisdom and beauty and is beyond speech and conception. 
	5. drawn into the true glory and the chief end of all goodness

- By doing so, he obtained the best knowledge of things natural, civil, and divine, and the sum of human felicity and bliss.
- If a city is abounded with such citizens, then it is a happy city even when it lacks wealth. 

The chief good of a man and of a commonwealth is therefore different, because:
For a man:
1. the body is to serve the soul
2. the desire is to obey reason
therefore, the chief good of a man is in mind, which is the most excellent virtue


#### 1.3.3.2 Aristotle according to Stoics(6I-6K)
place the chief good of man in **action** of virtue, but it will exceed the life of the gods because he is enjoying the sweet fruit of contemplation with rest and repose

**Bodin's comment**
not willing to stay or stray from Plato, and placed the chief good on action but with a ambiguity of words to make it the action of mind, which is contemplation. However, **contemplation and action are contrary to each other**.

It is necessary for man and commonwealth to be subject to motion and troubled with their necessary affairs, it follows that the chief good or happiness is not contemplation only.

#### 1.3.3.3 Moral Virtues(6K-7C)
If mind wants to free from disturbance, then it needs moral virtues
Therefore, moral virtues are of more worth and dignity
The end of moral virtue is intellect, therefore moral virtues are not the chief good. 

This is why Varro thought virtue is the mixture of moral virtue and intellect virtue, but the better way to say it is that man's life needs both and the chief good is contemplation (sweet death or precious death which puts people to heaven), but for a commonwealth, it cannot long stand if it cannot concern the preservation of the people's welfare.

#### 1.3.3.4 The perfect commonwealth(7C-8F)
The world:
the moon, the soul of the world filled with divine force imparts the same to these inferior bodies;

The little world:
the force of contemplation ravished out of the body and united to the God
If someone indulged in bodily pleasure, then the moon's sight of the sun will be shunned by the earth
If the moon never be separated from the sun, then the elementary world will perish

This also applies to a commonwealth, whose chief end and felicity is comprised of contemplative virtue and albeit public an political action are of less worth, it is still first and necessary

> The metaphor of macrocosm and microcosm
> The concept of the human being as a "microcosm" (a small universe) reflecting the "macrocosm" (the large universe) was a common philosophical and theological idea in the Middle Ages and early modern period. The idea was that the human soul corresponded to the divine, the human mind to the celestial sphere, and the human body to the earthly sphere.
> 
> Sun: understanding, intellectual virtue
> Moon: soul, moral virtue
> Earth: body(?), commonwealth

Example:
Almighty God:
only six days for us to travel and to our business, but on the seventh day he rested to contemplate.(??) 
Therefore we should employ the same in contemplation of his works, in meditation of his laws and giving of him praises. 

Particular man, all men in general, a commonwealth: 
the closer it reaches the end, the happier it gets. The calamity and bliss of a man or commonwealth is also according to their ends. 

Examples:
The Roman commonwealth surpassed the Lacedemonians because besides that they are courageous, they were propounded themselves to true justice

> Commonwealth: necessities --force--> good political actions: for necessities 
> end: good
> political actions does for necessity but points towards the end?
> both important


## Chap. 2: Of a Familie, and What Difference There is between a Family and a Commonwealth.
## 2.1 Definition(8H)
A family is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">right government</mark> of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">many subjects or persons</mark> under the obedience of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">one and the same head</mark> of the family, and of such <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">things as are to them proper</mark>.

1. *how:* right government 
2. *from what:* many subjects or persons
3. *of what:* under obedience of a head
4. *what of:* the properties of the family

> Compare: a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">lawful</mark> government of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">many families</mark>, and of that which unto them <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">in common belongs</mark>, with a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">puissant[^1] sovereignty</mark>.
> 1. How: a lawful government
> 2. from what: of many families
> 3. of what: belongs to families in common
> 4. what of: with puissant sovereignty

Family is the seminary and the beginning of a commonwealth as well as a principal member.

### 2.1.1 Aristotle and Xenophon's opinion(8I)
seems to have divided <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">economical government</mark> (family) from the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">political</mark> (city)

#### 2.1.1.1 Bodin's comment(8I-K)
if family is divided from the city, then why what is colleges (a kind of cooperation appointed or elected) and corporation (a kind of society like guild), since it is neither family nor city but a part of commonwealth?

1. Aristotle's economical government also applies to corps, colleges and cities, and 
2. in family we also comprehend the power and authority the master has over his people.

Therefore, it is not plausible to distinguish family and city with economical acquisition and political dominance. 

Homogeneity of good family and good commonwealth:
Every particular member of the body does its duty, then we live in good and perfect health; So if the family is kept in order, then the city shall be peacefully governed.
> In what sense does family serves as a model of the commonwealth, if it is in fact different?

## 2.2 The good order of a family(8B-)
1. college: more than 3 people
2. family: besides the master of the house, there needs to be either 
	1. children, 
	2. slaves or 
	3. men enfranchised or free born men who voluntarily submitted themselves to the master of the house
	4. Marriage is needed for families, colleges, companies and commonwealths to be <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">preserved and continued</mark>, therefore a wife is needed

> Why master of the house and the wife is excluded from a family? The children/slaves/free men needs to achieve the number of 3 to make a "family college"? 
> 李猛：The power of the family (corresponding to the puissant sovereignty) is outside the "family college" and in the hand of the master of a house, which is different from the body part (which is the head).
> The "college of a family" is under the authority of the master of a house, which is naturally different?
> 1+3+1

Therefore, there needs to be at least 5 people to make up, and a city or a commonwealth is made up from 3\*5=15 people

> Why do they so obsessed with number 3? In Roman Law, number 3 is important. One of its reason is to avoid a tie. But how is this related to a family?

No matter how much wives or slaves a family have, it only count as one family instead of people or a city, which is best expressed in Hebrew than Greek and Latin. 

> Why???? Why could a country to be necessarily consist of 3 

Will 3 colleges or corps(other assemblies that is not a family) make a commonwealth?
No, because college will not stand without a family.

the allegory of Ship of Theseus
Commonwealth never dies despite its components are constantly renewed.
The thing that made the ship a ship is the **sovereignty power**
>The power instead of structure defined a sovereignty? 
>What political action should a commonwealth do that cannot be without sovereignty?

As long as 3 families are united and have sovereign power(no matter on over the other two, or two over the third, or the three exercise power together over the people of the three families), then it is a commonwealth no matter what.

> how is it possible to exercise power together over the people of the three families? Won't it then be 3 heads?

Against Aristotle's view that Babylon is rather a nation than a commonwealth because it i s too big, or Rome or Persia cannot be a commonwealth.

>what Bodin wants to say is that Babylon could be a commonwealth, or an ideal political entity, despite its size, as long as it has the structure of a commonwealth, which is families united together with sovereignty, which is against Aristotle's view that an ideal political entity has a limited size.

Communities and individuals(11B-)
Communities coalesces from colleges and corps and also from favors given and received to and fro.
> The community from Cephalus' definition

It is natural to have community in a commonwealth because it would be hard to imagine a commonwealth without anything in common. 

The great part of a commonwealth should be for the citizens in general, while the least part should also belong to private ones.

Example:
Rome:
Two thirds of the land are public for sacrifices and defraying the charges
One third of the land are distributed to individuals, each of whom gets 2 acres.

It is wrong to have everything in common

Plato: 
wants wives and children to be common, (which Bodin thinks this view as making everything in common)

Bodin's comment(11E-12G)
Plato wants to eliminate the cause of all the discord and evils by eliminating private ownership, but
if nothing is private, then nothing is public??
If there is no family, there is no commonwealth??
> a bad refutation. Bodin wants private ownership and think it is against human nature, that's all.

Therefore Plato abolished this absurd view and moderately defended himself (:? the second best polis in Laws)

The difference between a family and a commonwealth(12G-)
A master of a family has the government of the domestic things
All the house should give something to the commonwealth
All subjects of a commonwealth may live together in common in manner of colleges or companies

Examples:
the Lacedemonians' men lives apart from their wives and children
the Crete's men, women, children eat and drink together
but they still have their properties

the Anabaptists practiced sharing all things in common, but it the mutual love expected did not appear.

Conclusion of the example:
which you should love must be your own, and the community is the mother of contention and discord
The more common love is, the more it is divided and less force it is of.

Particular families may have also their particular laws 
Examples:
Saxons
dukes of Bavaria
counties Palatines

## Chap. 3: Of the power of an Husband over his wife, as also of the mutually duties betwixt them: and whether it be expedient to renew the law of divorcement or not

assemblies of men lawfully joined together are kept together and preserved by the mutually duties of commanding and obeying

Power to command to public
1. public power
	1. free from law: who hold the chief place of sovereignty
	2. restrained from law: who has the power of the magistrates
2. private power
	1. domestic power: by general consent[^2] or the greater part 
		1. husband over wife
		2. father over children
		3. lord over slaves
		4. family over mercenary servants

right and lawful[^3] government depends on the due knowledge of commanding and obeying

Natural liberty: (: The command of God, to Adam and Eva (first mother)?)
a man next to God not to be subject to any man living
Reason is always conformable to the will of God.
The natural commandment of Reason over our affections and desires[^4], is the first, the greatest and the most ancient.

there is no other thing than to keep our affections obedient to Reason


Two understanding on God's command for Husband and Wife:
1. literally: the power the Husband has over his Wife
2. morally: the soul command has over the body, and reason over affection

Salomon
treat women most kind and thereby is the women's sworn enemy
(leave this question to philosophers and divines)

power the Husband has over the Wife
husband does not has power over concubine
concubine: 
frank and free
rejected as an example of dishonest and evil

(15C-D)
does not extend to that is betrothed, which husband should not lay his hand on his fiancé. If he exerted force, then he should be punished by 

words (laws) + de facto connection of bodies (consent by other cultures)

How the husband sometimes has not of right power over his wife and why:
If he is a slave, or the son of the master of the family, then the right of father prevails the right of husband. (the right of husband should be the right of family); 
It is false that the wife must be set liberal by the house master, because one is the master of his own house. (LiMeng: refute that children is the property of the house master)

Example:
Leo Ambassador

Divorcement by the law of God allowed

Conceal the cause in divorcement

If divorce is forbidden, then there will be disaster(B)

Chap 4 Of the power of a Father, and whether it be meet for the Father to have power of life and death over his children as had the intent Romans.



[^1]: having great power or influence
[^2]: seems that it was added by the translator, head commands the few which is consented by all (referring to heads of families), or the greater part commands the few (referring to corporations)
[^3]: French: right; Latin: lawful.
[^4]: Latin: only one word instead of "affections and desires", which is animal desire, a more negative connotation
