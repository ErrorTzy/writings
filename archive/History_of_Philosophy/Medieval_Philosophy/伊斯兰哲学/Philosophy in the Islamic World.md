## Chapter 1: The Straight path philosophy and Islam
### Three traditions after antiquity:
1. Byzantine Philosophy 
- Maximus Confessor, for the eastern empire did not not get memo from some headquarters telling them stop philosophizing.
2. Latin Philosophy
- In most of the other Western empire, Latin became the sole language of philosophy.
3. Philosophy in the Islamic world
- Announced itself as the "straight path philosophy"
- Contains Christians, which played a major role in the early developments, and Jewish thinkers the philosophy of which took place between the ninth and thirteenth centuries almost entirely within the territories dominated by Islams

622AD:  The beginning of Islamic calendar (A.H.)
The Prophet Mohammad led his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina. 

### The title: 
- Islam: referring to religion which excluded Jews and Christians.
- Arabic: referring to language which excluded Hebrew and Persian.
- Koran (or Qor'an, means recitation): "We have made it for you an Arabic Koran", which is very different from the bible
- However Arabic was not restricted to Muslims. Hebrew, Persian are also important for language for philosophy in the Islamic world.

### The catalogue:
#### Before Avicenna: Formative period
- The main concern is the translation and interpretation of Greek philosophical texts, especially Aristotle.
- The Jewish and Christian authors staged their own appropriation of Aristotle and Neoplatonism to explain the descriptions of God in the Old Testament or expound the doctrine of the Trinity.

#### After Avicenna: The forking path
- Philosophy in the eastern heartlands of the Islamic empire was consumed with the task of responding to him instead of Aristotle.
- However in the western fringe of the Islamic empire (Iberian peninsula)， where the influence of Avicenna was not that great, still be able to adopt Aristotelian or Neoplatonism, even to complain that this confounded Avicenna was ruining everything and the right-minded philosophers should go back to Aristotle, which the the attitude of **Averroes**.

Until the empire fragmented into the Ottomans, the Safavids in Persia and the Mughal in India

### Key issue:
- Trinitarian doctrine v.s. tawḥīd (oneness)
- What was the mechanism by which Muḥammad and other prophets had come to possess a wisdom beyond other humans? Did this wisdom go beyond any understanding that can be achieved through human resources? How do prophecy, and knowledge more generally, serve to legitimize the political power wielded by leaders like Muḥammad? And, not to put too fine a point on it, but once God has sent numerous messengers with divinely revealed books to bring us the truth, do we really need Aristotle and Plotinus too?

## Chapter 2: All for one: the Mu'Tazilites
Key issue: Who could be the successor after Muhammad died? Who should be recognized as an authoritative interpreter of Koran?

Umayyad Caliphate -> Abbasid Caliphate
(the descendent of Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet)

### Al-Ma'mūn
- A caliph in the Abbasid Caliphate, claiming that Koran was created by god but not eternal like God and slaughtered those who disagreed.
- Testing religious orthodoxy which was previously done by scholars.
- His idea of the Koran's createdness was from the Mu'Tazilites
- The legend goes that he had a dream that Aristotle visited him, and then he woke up and subsidized a massive translation movement.

### Mu'Tazilites (meaning: the one who withdrew)
- based on Koran, hadith and reason(ʿaql), which separates its practitioners from the theology of Kalam and traditionalist bent
- Main dogma: 
	1. God is one and 
	2. he is just.

#### Principles
##### God is one
- God's reality is the reality same as ours.
- Not only that God is unique, but also god is utterly free from any kind of multiplicity. i.e. The god is not distinct from its attribute because he connected "atomic body" with "attributes" and thus made atoms which composed us.
##### God's justice
- The ground rule: No one can be morally responsible for actions that are not in their own power.
- If god is just in punishing and rewarding human for what they do, then the humans must have free will.

#### The non-eternal Koran:
- From the first principle: If the God's word is eternal, then it would be to deny "tawhid", or oneness.
- From the second principle: 
	- If the God's word is eternal, then the sinners have no free will.  
	- If some have no free will, then God is not just.
	- God is just.
	- Therefore God's world is not eternal.

#### The founder: Wāṣil ibn ʿAṭā (748)
focusing on the question of sin and moral responsibility.
Could believers also counted as sinners?
- Other theologian: Yes
- Wāṣil: intermediate 

#### Jahm ibn Ṣafwān(d. 745/6):
- The divine attribute is not real and distinct, which is applauded by the Mu'Tazilites, but human are determined by god.

#### Abū l-Hudhayl
- The one who systemized the teaching of the movement
- God is identical to both His attributes, such as knowledge and His mercy. Then he argues that the attributes were neither identical nor distinct from each other, because only in relation to the things God creates that attributes that became distinct. It is **a contrast of "attributes of essence" and "attributes of action"**, which the former describing the unity that is God himself, and the latter relations that God bears to the things He creates.

#### Physics:
##### atomist physics:
- For bodies can not exist without properties, while properties came into and out of existence, bodies must be created.
- If the universe is made of bodies, then the universe is created and there is a creator.
- Problems: what are the fundamental atoms of properties?

##### kalam physics(al-Naẓẓām: a radical one)
- all the body are properties, such as colors, tastes, hardness, etc. The "latent" property became bodies when God "manifest" it. i.e. Wood lights on fire its latent heat and brightness suddenly manifest themselves.
- asserting that bodies are infinitely divisible
- The solution to Zeno's paradoxes: How is motion possible if bodies are infinitely divisible? Bodies do not glide but leaped from one position to another.

> In order to state that god is one while god is not distinct from our reality, The Mu'Tazilites argued that the properties of God was distinct from God were a fallacy because the reason we think every body possess properties is that god created properties and bodies, and then combined them together into atoms, and then used atoms to create the world. Atomism gives the universalness of the properties.

## Chapter 3: Founded in Translation: From Greek to Syriac to Arabic

begin in the late eighth century, ended in the tenth century
Bayt al-Ḥikma (House of wisdom)

### Why did they do it?
- The translators were handsomely paid for their services, which means a sustained effort sponsored at the highest levels.
- The translations motivated by some common-sense usefulness that includes astrology (which was desired to be used in propaganda and prediction of the future)
- cultural rivalry

### Philosophy in Syria
Syria, where Greek remained a commonly used language, was the bilingual Christian intermediaries who produced Syriac translations and commentaries on Greek philosophical literature.
Sergius of Reshʿaynā: Wrote in Syriac about the meaning of Aristotle's work.
The monastery of Qenneshre: Translating Aristotle's work into Syriac

#### Why did they do it?
- Logic training being the most fundamental training to be a philosopher, the Syriac Christians thought that philosophy culminated not with Plato but with pseudo-Dionysius which concerns theology.

### From Syria to Isamic World:
#### Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq: 
- from a Christian of Syrian extraction who lived in Iran
- Specialized in the works of the Greek medical authority Galen
- the son, Isḥāq ibn Ḥunayn, of which produced a number of Arabic translation of Aristotle
#### Kindi circle:
- named after al-Kindi

### The Translation
- Plotinus' and Proclus' work was reorganized into a book and was mislabeled as the work of Aristotle. 
- A selection of material by Plotinus was even called *Theology of Aristotle*.
- There are many modifications made in order to cater to the readership, or to conciliate with the translator himself. i.e. In the original text of *Theology*, Plotinus disagreed with Aristotle for many parts while when it was translated in Arabic, the refutations became "a misunderstanding of Aristotle" and the Aristotle idea became "the idea of the most excellent philosopher". By doing that, however, Aristotle's definition was even assimilated to Plotinus' own theory of soul.

## Chapter 4: Philosopher of the Arabs: Al-kindi

#### Al-Kindi 
- did not know Greek, but he improved the translated text -- possibly just in terms of style, possibly also with respect to content.
- noble lineage, the son of an emir of the city Kufa

#### *On First philosophy*
- Refutation from the theologists that Hellenic philosophical material was superfluous at best: The truth is valuable wherever we find it, and Greek ideas could provide support and explication for Muslim beliefs.
- Al-Kindi seems to understand metaphysics rather narrowly as philosophical theology. For him, the first philosophy should study **the first cause**, which is God.
- Another question is about if **the cosmos is eternal or not**, which is inspired by the Mu'Tazilites. Al-Kindi's argument were from John Philoponus.

##### The eternity of the universe:

Aristotelian argument:
	No body can be infinitely large.
	Any feature of a finite body must itself be finite.
	Time measures motion
	motion is the attribute of body
	body is finite
	$\therefore$ Time and body is finite

Aristotle:
Distinguishing that:
1. Actual infinity that is in an unending body, where the infinite is actually present in its entirety, and the kind of infinity involved unending time.
2. Potential infinity, such as counting numbers, or time.
Al-Kindi completely missed the point that Aristotle distinguished actual infinity  and potential infinity.

Philoponus' argument:
	If the universe has already existed eternally, then an infinite time must *already* have elapsed in order to reach the present moment.
	An infinite time cannot finish elapsing.
	$\therefore$ Past is not eternal.

**It is not the nature of the universe that determines how long it exists, but the will of God.**(See the dispute on the celestial sphere and the Al-Kindi's argument adopted Aristotle's view whereas argues that the God can make the indestructable thing cease to exist.)

##### The divine providence:
- The heaven serves as an instrument of the divine providence, while the God rather stands off. In contrary to the Mu'Tazilites' position that God is the direct cause of things, God is thus the "proximate" cause of things.
- Astrology could observe heavenly movement would allow us to predict the future.
- We have learnt God's effect, but we haven't learned God himself.

##### Soul:
- Though Al-Kindi eventually got access to Aristotle's On the Soul, his idea was mainly **Platonism**, which views soul as immaterial, having three parts, the chief part of which is reason,  
- The knowledge starts out in a potential state and the illuminated by intellect

## Chapter 5: The Chosen Ones: Philosophy and Judaism

### Mishnah
- Not a monograph but a collection of teachings of many scholars called "rabbis".
- it seems to be a book of legal judgments at first glance, which are divided into six large sections(or orders)

### Midrash and Talmud
- Midrash is the commentary on Scriptures, which is divided into two parts: legal rulings and non-legal subjects.
- Talmud is the commentary on Mishnah, which has two versions: the Babylonian and the Palestinian Talmud.

### Isaac Israeli
- A traveler born in Egypt, acquainted with the work of Al-kindi and became the first thinker of Jewish Neoplatonists.
- Also a doctor who distinguished spirit (a concept came from Galen), which would perish when the body died, and immortal soul.
### Ibn Gabirol
- A twist in the scheme of emanation:
	- Greek Neoplatonists: All things pour forth necessarily from a highest principle which is nous, the absoute one.
	- Isaac & Ibn: God -> matter and form(following immediately after God) -> mind -> soul -> universe
	- With the intervening of the mind, the soul and the heavenly bodies, things created starts to stray from the perfection.
- Problem:
	- How is it possible that many things come forth from a principle that is purely one?

Mu'tazilites in Judism
- For their valorization on human reason and words, it became a rich resource for Karaites to stand against the rabbinic Judaism that the Torah should be explained through human rationality, while those rabbinic text was suspicious.

## Chapter 6: Reasoned Belief: Saadia Gaon(882)

- a judge, commentator on the Bible, linguist and philosopher, who produces a much-used Arabic translation of the Hebrew Bible and probably the first working of Hebrew grammar.
- Appointed as the Gaon of the Jewish academy in the city of Sura at the age of 36. Gaon means head of the rabbinic academies in Babylon.
- He was seen not a philosopher but a *mutakallim*, which means theologist. He is even called as a "Jewish Mu'tazilite"  

### The Book of Doctrines and Beliefs:
#### 3 sources of Knowledge
- Senses.
- Reason (Instead of saying the law of logic or the mathematical truth, **which is not what he is trying to argue**, Saadia mentioned how we **instinctively approve of the truth itself**). (a priori?)
- Inference from the first two (When I see smoke and infer that there is fire, or build up more complex mathematical truth from the simple ones I can gras immediately)
- The testimony (Highly controversial). But we are able to know it's right because the Scriptures is in harmony with reason.

#### God and his creation of the universe:
- From sense we cannot sense it immediately, but we can begin with our senses by sensing the world around us and then realize that it must derive from some cause.
- From reason we can prove the universe is not eternal because every body must be created, and this implies that there is an incorporeal and eternal cause.

##### Overlapped points with Al-Kindi
- Whether universe is eternal is one that is settled by intellectual speculation alone.
- Nothing can cause itself
- A consideration on God's attributes

##### Divine property
The divine property is an illusion, and all these are the same. This is just because of the deficiency of our words itself because we don't have ONE word to name these properties.

##### Trinity
- Criticizing trinity and explains that the reason for Christians doing so was they saw "alive, powerful and knowing" not as one but three.

#### On Morality
- God's justice is giving man the ability to do what he has commanded and to avoid what God has forbidden.
- Although god foreknew my actions, not God but I caused my action by using my own power of choice.

#### On Revelation:
- Most laws of God can be discovered by reason, but some might be inaccessible. The reason is that God wants to increase our happiness.

## Chapter 7: Al-Razi


A doctor
medical writing remains while philosophical writing were mostly lost. Yet we can gather the refutation of his theory from other authors

Galen --> doubts to Galen

mistakes in Galen's work

introduction to medicine --> introduction to Galenic medicine

work in hospital in Bagkdad

medical authority in Latin and Arabic world

philosophical writing are almost all lost

only preserved by other authors, like pre-socratic thinkers

Galen -> Timaeus

god with soul, matter, time and space:
- The universe was created in time but was proceeded by no less than 5 entities. Before universe was created, God was accompanied by 4 other principles: soul, matter, time and space.
- There needs to be some matter to form the universe and god cannot create anything from nothing, the point of which is inspired by Plato, Timaeus. (a passive principle that receives form from God)
- Time and space is needed for anyone to do anything, thus god cannot create time and space. This absolute time just passes and the absolute space is the infinite void that god put the cosmos in, while relative time is set, like day, is set by the sunset and the sunrise, which require physical things and physical change. (to create time -> do something; do something --> presuppose time)
- absolute time/place vs. relative time/place, from Aristotle; improvement: number 4 --> number 5
- The God is perfectly wise and benevolent, but there are so many sufferings in the world. This means there is a foolish soul which cause arbitrary moment within eternal time. (foolish soul from Plutarch) 
- Why God allows soul to be foolish? God allow soul to do such things in order to teach soul a lesson, and God endows matter with **form**, which makes soul sees the form while entangling with matter and finally ignores bodily concerns, the process of which is called "liberation".

Introduction to Medicine
- Mostly accepted Galon's view.

Comprehensive Book
- clinical observations, which is incredibly long, whose modern printing of it could stuff a long shelf, and made him earned his esteem as an outstanding contributor to the history of medicine whose only rival might be Avicenna.

Debate with Mu'Tazlite:

- deny that God choose prophets, thus we should depend on reason; reason is to used to confirm takkled
- but this may be distorted

## Chapter 8: Aristotelian Society: The Baghdad school

A group of mostly Christian thinkers who staged a revival of the philosophical activities of the late ancient Alexandria.

Ibn Adi, "the logician"
- defend Monophysite Christianity and criticize Nestorianism
- Grammer is the study of discipline which has nothing to do with truth, while logic is the study of verbal expressions insofar as they are related to things.
- God knows contingent things without causing them to do so. God's knowledge is necessary only when he is causing it himself, or it's on form, matter, final cause or efficient cause.
- **the features of knowledge (such as necessity, or immutability) are those appropriate to the knower, not to what is known**

Ibn al-Ṭayyib
- The last member of Baghdad school
- commented on Aristotle's Categories

al-Sīrāfī v.s. Abū Bishr (founder of the Baghdad school)
- Abū Bishr: Studing logic is important because it transcends language. As long as logical form   is valid and premises are true, it does not matter what language you use. 
- al-Sīrāfī: You still need a specific language to express the universal logic, and there are quite some nasty things in language that keeps you from using it to transfer logic. Therefore studying grammar is more important to studying logic.

## Chapter 9: The Second Master: Al-Farabi
- Frist systematic philosopher

### Contingent property of argument: Comments on On Interpretation
- There is no necessary truth but only contingent argument on future if it's not itself necessary. 

### Hierarchy of science: 
- metaphysics as first philosophy upon which everything is built.
- we need to first study logic instead of metaphysics because it's around us.

### How to achieve the "ultimate happiness" of mankind?
*Principles of the Opinions of the Inhabitants of the Virtuous City* and *The Political Regime*
God(pure mind) -> emit intellect -> cascade -> the lowest intellect, which is in our world and contained any possible knowledge. It bestow forms upon things, and bestow knowledge of necessity into mind.

## Chapter 10: State of Mind: Al-Farabi on religion and politics
### The City As Human Body
- As the doctor uses the medical art t impose good order on the body, so the ruler imposes good order on the citizens under his rule. 
- His discussed about cities but not empire, which is greatly inspired by ancient works.
- a virtuous city is one in which the citizens, with the help of their ruler, have acquired the right opinions and perform the right actions. By contrast, "ignorant" city are full of people doing the wrong things because they hold wrong opinions. "Ignorant" cities pursue honor, wealth, or pleasure rather than genuine happiness.
- The citizens only possess opinions but not knowledge.
- The leader needs to know the true goal, which is true happiness, as well as how to achieve the goal.
- Laws are handed down as an illustration of the ruler's practical ability.
- The ideal ruler is not only a ruler but also a prophet because subjects don't need true knowledge but they will accept the revelation of symbols.
- When a prophet leader dies:
	- Ideally, he would be by another such ruler
	- Failing that, a group of people collectively have the traits
	- If all these could not do, the citizens should adhere to the laws as closely as possible
	- If there is no clear solution in the existing law, we turn to jurisprudence.
- Jurisprudence stays within the legal framework and the symbolic world of religion, while philosophy finds the true basis of the law. Rational theology with its dialectic nature is similar to jurisprudence, but some theologians failed to see their enterprise.

## Chapter 11: Eye of the beholder: Theories of vision

Three streams of vision Theory: Plato, Aristotle and atomists

### Plato: Timaeus, extramissionist, seeing is "touching"
- There is an invisible stream of pure fire emitted from our eyes, and then encountered a kindred fire outside, namely light. The resulting connection causes a motion in the soul, namely seeing.
- a refined version could also be found in Galen's work, which *pneuma* is distilled in the brain out of breathe and the brain sent pneuma to the eyes, and the *pneuma* affects the air in front of the eyes to whatever we see transforming it into an Instrument that brings the visual organ into contact with the visual object.

--> developed into ray theory with the help of geometry
- the object must be illuminated, and we can see objects as long as the medium does not block us.
- Problem: how do we get the information back from the far end?
 Ibn al-Haytham and Avicenna pointed out this problem

### Aristotle, intromissionist: seeing is "being touched"
- the air is needed and must be illuminated
- advantages: explains the phenomenon of illusions
- objection: if visual form is transmitted through medium, then why do we see one thing differently from different angle.

Ibn al-Haytham objected extramissionists (including Al-Kindi) but adopted the geometrical method


## Chapter 13: Balancing acts: Arabic Ethical Literature
### Galenic ethics:
- Physical state can affect one's soul
- Galen used a Platonic categorization of the soul parts, which reason should dominate desire with the righteous indignation provided by spirit. Psychological disorders happen when the lower part of soul is out of control.

### Al-Razi: Spiritual Medicine
 - ethical advice for a healthy body -- can ethic itself be a medicine?
 - human have two distinct feature from animals:
	 1. able to see the consequence of their own conduct
	 2. never-ending desire
- the definition of pleasure: removing the harmful state of your body
- but the bodily pleasure is just for keeping us alive so that we can keep perusing knowledge. Ultimately we should look forward not to any bodily pleasure but the freedom from body we enjoy in the afterlife.
- Al-Razi responded to the critics, both the critics and Al-Razi confused Socrates with Diogenes and portrayed Socrates as a ascetic, that a life of moderation is better than extreme asceticism.

### Al-Kindi: On Dispelling Sorrows
- if we want to immune to sorrow, the only surefire method is to place no value whatsoever on things that can be destroyed.
- Has a strong influence from the stoic author Epictetus.


### Ibn-Adi: Refinement of Character
- He allows that what is virtuous for one person might be evil in another. For instance, a king can do things commonly understood as immoral behavior
- For most people, a life of moderation is enough, while radical ascetic, which is the ultimate lifestyle, is for a selected few

### Miskawayh: Refinement of Character
- A real Aristotelian who advocates a moderate life.

## Chapter 14: Undercover brothers: Philosophy in the Buyid Age

### Kindian tradition:
- Al-Kindi (9th century)
- his followers: Abū Maʿshar al-Balkhī and Abū Zayd al-Balkhī
- Abū Zaydis student: al-ʿĀmirī
	- reworked Al-Kind's work *the elements of theology*
- Miskawayh (11th century): a libararian, a shiite from Persia

### Buyids age:
- Al-Tawḥīdī
- the Berethen:
	- the Epistles which divided into different groups and studied different aspects of philosophy.
- Ismāʿīlīs (a branch of Shiittes): the transcendence of God
	- God is not only not perfect (because god has no attribute) but also not not perfect (like saying blue is not heavy, it actually implies that blue has some weight, which is inappropriate. Similarly, saying God is not perfect is also inappropriate because the concept is just irrelevant. Therefore God is not not perfect.)
	- Nāṣir Khusraw
		- The first one who comosed philosophical works in Persian.
	- The Ismailis did not managed to convert the Buyids and Samanids to Shiites whereas the rue of Buyids caused a "Sunni revival"

## Chapter 15 God Willing: The Ash'Arites

### Does moral laws bounds God or God could designate right or wrong?

#### The Mu'tazilites: 
- The God is bounded by moral law which could be discovered by our reason
- The problem of Mu'tazilites: God send babies to limbo

#### Abū l-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī (874-936) and Ash'arism
- Contemporary of al-Razi and Saadia Gaon, a generation younger than al-Farabi
- Was once a Mu'Tazilite but then devised refutation on most Mu'Tazilites' tenants and became a theological tradition of Sunni Islam: Ash'arism
- The divine command theory: whatever god does is just no matter how unjust it may sound because just means the agreement with God's will.
	- proof: killing is a neutral action and depends on the context. The content is provided ultimately by God's law.
- The stability we experience everyday(i.e. we feel pain every time we fall on the ground) is just God's choice to make things appear stable, something promised in the Koran in verses stating "you shall find no change in the way of God" (???why)
- If human can create their action, then it is not  necessary that God is the sole creator of all things. Yet God is the creator of an evil action, but we acquired the action. Thus man still bear the responsibility.
- If there is any unrealized power, then it there must be a power to use another power. Then this power to use another power needs another power, which will cause infinite regress, which means i need to deploy infinite numbers of further power to in order to do anything.
- The God is independent of our reality.
- They criticized philosophy, not Plato or Aristotle, but Avicenna.

#### The conflict between the Mu'Tazilites and the Ash'arism:
- when God has power over something, it is outside human control, and when humans have power over something, it is outside God’s control.

## Chapter 16: The Self-Made Man: Avicenna's Life And Works
- His father was the governor of a village near Bukhara.
- He clashed with the Bagdad school a lot and only praised al-Farabi. There are evidence that he was influenced by Neoplatonism, but it was obvious that the greatest influence was Aristotle. He covered most Aristotelian aspects with his own original arguments.

## Chapter 17: By the Time I Get to Phoenix: Avicenna On Existence
### Aristotelian modal logic:
 - the "statistical" or "frequentist" view: impossible means that it never occurs. Contingent means that it sometimes occurs.

### Avicenna:
- statistical implication & compatibility of nature
- difference between essence and existence: i.e. the essence of a triangle doesn't imply that it exists, while a round square is by its essence non-exist
- A thing that never existed is impossible to exist because things are contingent in themselves were made necessary through external causes. However this kind of distinguish that there are two kinds of "impossibility" was not given by Avicenna

## Chapter 18: By All Means Necessary: Avicenna On God
- The existence of the collection of contingent things, either contingent or necessary, and the latter would prove that there is a necessary existence, is caused by external cause, which can't be contingent or impossible. Thus there is a necessary existence.
- uniqueness of the necessary existence: since they are existence-independent, they cannot cause each other, which means they cannot be the cause of the difference. Also there cannot be a third party to cause the difference or they will be contingent. (???)
- oneness of the necessary existence: if something has parts, then it caused difference of its parts, which makes its parts contingent, and a necessary existence cannot have contingent parts. (???)
- immaterial of the necessary existence: every material is separable

## Chapter 19: Into the Air: Avicenna On Soul
- The real intellectual progress is made by finding the linking, or middle, terms of syllogistic arguments.

The flying man: will he be aware of himself?
- Avicenna insists that self-awareness is more fundamental than any kind of mental activity.
- One might be aware of himself but not awaring his own body, which means one's self is an incorporeal soul. However such argument follows the rule of belief logic and might fail.
The soul
- Mind is immaterial because knowledge transcends material when going from particular to universal. However for Avicenna, unlike Descartes, only the rational part of the soul is separable from the body. Souls are different because they have different pieces of matters.
- We need the body for the soul the acquire knowledge, which soul could not do it on its own, which is different from the platonic aspect that body is a mere hinderance to the soul in terms of acquiring knowledge.
- A sheep could sense the hositility of a wolf, therefore their is a sense called "Wahm" which could sense abstract things.
- We acquire universals through induction, while at the same time an Intellect Agent give us the form of the particular.

## Chapter 20-21: Special Delivery: Al-Ghazali
- the only source of our Knowledge is senses while the senses are unreliable and deceitful.
- wants to find a way out of skepticism, but failed to do so with intellect. Yet he claimed that God saved him from it.
- The Shiite Buyids fall out of power and Sunni Seljuqs got power, which is called "Sunni Revival"
- 4 ways to truth: kalām(limited), philosophy(with the God reassuring the certainty of math and logic), Sufism and Isma'ilism(taqlīd?)
- Deliverence of Error, Aims of the Philosophers, Incoherence of the Philosophers
- He criticized Avicenna's philosophy as heresy due to 3 arguments that God only know universals, universe is eternal not created and only souls live after death.
- obsessed with the question that if an argument is demonstrative, which is a legacy he passed on to the later Muslim theologians.
- The real core of al-Ghazali's disagreement with Avicenna was that he wants to uphold God's untrammeled power. Avicenna would think God's action is totally out of necessity, which mean he could not choose arbitrarily at which moment  will the cosmos be created, while al-Ghazali thinks God is free thus able to have arbitrary decisions.
- God is the real agent of all events. Some interpreters think he totally denied causation that everything was created by God and God only make things appeared to have some predictable regulations in it. Others argues that it is different to say one thing does not necessitate their effects is different from the fact that it caused nothing at all. God could intervene the causation chain but it would proceed as long as God did nothing.
