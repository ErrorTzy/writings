@barneyCalliclesThrasymachus2017 : 
Thrasymachus: No reason to believe in justice.
Callicles: Good reason to believe injustice. 
Glaucon: Need no reason to believe injustice to disbelieve justice.
# What is the conventional understanding of justice in ancient Greek culture?
## Hesiod: instances of justice

The underlying unity: 

1. Unjust behavior is prohibited by nomos, and thus just people are the law-abiding ones
2. Injustice is motivated by pleonexia(or greed)[@balotGreedInjusticeClassical2001]

Hesiod seems to waver because the rewards and punishments the gods provide does not show what is good and bad, in that

1. a whole city may suffer for the injustice of its leaders, and 
2. retribution may fall on a man's descendant.

## Homer: arete

Paradigmatically for the warriors, the key value of which are courage and practical intelligence. Arete enables people to function successfully in his social role.

**Conclusion**: Hesiod and Homer can easily contradict each other. i.e. Meno's third definition of virtue. This conflict opens up 5th century BC moral debate [@adkinsMeritResponsibilityStudy1960]. 

# What's Thrasymachus' position?
Thrasymachus' position seems to be less mature than Callicles'.

## Interpretative Strategies:

### 1. Thrasymachus is offering an consistent definition

Barney thinks this implausible because it has to claim that one of Thrasymachus' claim takes priority or limits the scope of the others. All such readings seems to read more into the text and it's hard to say it's what Plato intended.

### 2. Thrasymachus is offering a slogan √

Thrasymachus is offering a debunking or critique of justice instead of a new theory about it [[@andersonThrasymachusSophisticAccount2016]]. Justice is actually not advantageous and merely a tool of social control.

## Answer 1: Conventionalism
(strategy 1)
Conventionalism means that justice is the laws that the community dictate. 

> Legal positivism?

It is closer to **Hesiod**'s position because he also associates just behavior with law-abidingness, although not involving the cynic part that laws are dictated by the rulers.
**Socrates** also seems to advocate conventionalism according to Xenophon (Memorabilia, IV4)[^1].
**Antiphon** also said "Justice\[dikaiosune\]… is not violating the rules\[nomima\] of the city in which one is a citizen" (tr. @gagarinEarlyGreekPolitical1995), and goes on argues that it frustrates our nature. 
**Callicles** and other sophists also uses the contrast between nomos and physis as a central tool. 

**Barney:** This view is not right, because 

1. Thrasymachus did not use this theoretical framework that contrasts nomos and physis. 
2. Conventionalism treats all socially recognized laws as equal, whereas on Thrasymachus' account not all ruler or act of legislation counts as the real thing.

## Answer 2: Immoralism √
(strategy 2)
Thrasymachus' debunking is not purely neutral. Thrasymachus' account based on two assumptions:

1. wealth and power, and the pleasures comes from them are naturally good.
2. For one member in a community to have more is for another to have less.

> [[@hendersonDefenseThrasymachus1970]] seems to have seized assumption 2.

From the two assumptions, Thrasymachus is actually arguing that

1. Intelligent man sees through the fake myth of justice and does what is good.
2. Unintelligent man practices justice.

Thrasymachus' understanding of rationality is clearer in rejecting Cleitophon and raising the idea of "the ruler in precise speech".

**Barney**: Thrasymachus is not full-blown Callicles because 

1. He does not agree that it is right and proper that the stronger takes the advantage of the weak; Instead, he hesitates and only thinks it is intelligent to do so.


**Conclusion**: Thrasymachus is actually somewhere between debunking Hesiod's tradition (conventionalism) and Callicles' position (immoralism).

# What's Socrates' refutation?

## The first three arguments:
[The "nature of craft" argument](@barneySocratesRefutationThrasymachus2006a#2.1%20The%20%22nature%20of%20craft%22%20argument), [The "wage-earning" argument](@barneySocratesRefutationThrasymachus2006a#2.2%20The%20%22wage-earning%22%20argument), [The "non-pleonectic" argument](@barneySocratesRefutationThrasymachus2006a#2.3%20The%20%22non-pleonectic%22%20argument) 
all rely on the premise that the ruler in the precise speech is practicing a craft. Socrates' refutation raises the fundamental question that **what is the relationship between practical reasoning and justice** because the ideal ruler for both Socrates and Thrasymachus is an ideal of an successful rational agency. 

> What is the relationship between ruling and justice? 
> It seems that ultimately, Thrasymachus took "the ruler ought to rule according to his own advantage" for granted, without any rational account. (This might because he took "All should act in accordance with his own advantage." for granted. Notice that, for now, Thrasymachus has not yet defined advantage as wealth and power.) Socrates is attacking this point by giving an rational account on how can one deduct any "ought to" from "is": by the defect of that of which is the art. After teaching Thrasymachus, he uses the art of shepherd to counter Socrates' claim. But consider the art of hunting: the hunter does not have to think the prey, which is the gaining of hunting, is advantageous to him. Therefore, Thrasymachus still does not give a rational account about why a ruler OUGHT TO practice the art of wage-earning.


## The last two arguments:

[The "gang-of-thieves" argument](@barneySocratesRefutationThrasymachus2006a#2.4%20The%20%22gang-of-thieves%22%20argument), [The "function" argument](@barneySocratesRefutationThrasymachus2006a#2.5%20The%20%22function%22%20argument) seem to reveal the psychological effect of justice. 
The fourth argument tells us justice enables other virtues to be exercised in successful action. 

**The fifth argument** indicates that Socrates' view can be reconciled with Homeric justice conception of "functional" justice. In fact, the whole Republic can be understood as the reconciliation between Homeric justice (functional justice) and Hesiodic justice (law-abidingness justice).

No one finds Socrates' arguments satisfying because his refutation does not tell us **what justice is**, or **how justice comes to have this effect**. 

the Republic is actually responding to Glaucon and Adeimantus, it is misleading to say the whole Book II-X is aimed at Thrasymachus argument, because Thrasymachus' argument is only preliminary.

# What's Callicles' position?

Is Callicles a real person, or a mere invention? Dodds thinks Callicles could be either a real person, or a fragment of Plato himself [-@platoGorgias1959{12,14}]. 

# What's the difference between Thrasymachus and Callicles?

Callicles is giving a positive construction, but Thrasymachus is offering a social criticism without giving an alternative. 

Thrasymachus' argument is liable to progress to Callicles' "heroic" position, but Glaucon shows us that it is not necessary because immoralism is not heroic but for everybody.

**Antiphon** also has a stance closest to Glaucon's which says that justice is defined by laws, and there is no good reason to obey laws except the punishment, while nature has its own laws.


[^1]: the lawful and the just are the same
