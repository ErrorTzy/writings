In Republic Book I, Thrasymachus prohibited Socrates to answer him the definition of justice with certain answers. Socrates responds to the prohibition by a mathematical analogy.

The following scholars all fail to notice the importance of this analogy:
[[@whiteCompanionPlatoRepublic1979]], [[@annasIntroductionPlatoRepublic1981]], [[@craigWarLoverStudy1996]], [[@tancredPlatoRepublicGreek1998]], [[@platoRepublicPlatoSecond1991]], [[@straussCityMan1978]]: all of them above did not mention it.

[[@platoRepublic1892]] thinks this indicates that Thrasymachus is a sophist.
[[@bosanquetCompanionPlatoRepublic2012]] take this as a Socratic common place.
[[@reevePhilosopherKingsArgumentPlato2006]] sees Thrasymachus' complain as showing a deep knowledge of Socratic philosophical method.
[[@crossPlatoRepublicPhilosophical1971]] and [[@benardeteSocratesSecondSailing1989]] points out that one is not justified to dismiss philosophical possibilities.
[[@lycosPlatoJusticePower1987]] consider this as a complaint about treating justice as an intrinsic good.

[[@nicholsonUnravellingThrasymachusArguments1974]] think previous interpretation all presuppose that Thrasymachus is offering a different answer, but Thrasymachus is actually offering a different *way* of answering. @weltonThrasymachusVsSocrates2006 agrees with him but thinks that he fail to notice the importance of the mathematical analogy.

[[@benardeteSocratesSecondSailing1989]] thinks that the prohibition is an example of Thrasymachus making a law that will turn out contradicts to his own position. @weltonThrasymachusVsSocrates2006 believe this makes sense, but "the ruler in the precise speech" should be a better candidate.

# What's Thrasymachus' motivation of his prohibition?

## Reason 1: the forbidden answers are nonsense (φλυαρία) (336b), in contrast to speaking precisely (ἀκριβῶς) and clearly (σαφῶς) (336d).

@weltonThrasymachusVsSocrates2006 thinks these examples simply replace justice with another word the meaning of which is as unclear and subject to dispute.
[[@sparshottSOCRATESTHRASYMACHUS1966]] thinks they are nevertheless ambiguous than the terms they replace.
[[@platoRepublicPlato1902]] calls them "stale and barren platitudes"
[[@platonRepublic1982]] thinks Thrasymachus is objecting to the definition by substitution of synonyms.

## Reason 2: The list is identical to what have been refuted by Cleitophon
see [Frist attempt the advantageous, the needful, the beneficial, the profitable. (409c)](Outline_Cleitophon#2.1.2.1%20Frist%20attempt%20the%20advantageous,%20the%20needful,%20the%20beneficial,%20the%20profitable.%20(409c))

**conclusion**: it is not considered a good answer

## In what aspect does Thrasymachus prohibit the analogy?

The problem is not with the choice of number or the mathematical because Thrasymachus would still thinks the cases are not alike if we replace it with thirteen is six added to seven

> This is a poor argument from a historical point of view

Reasons Thrasymachus may think the two cases are different include 

1. mathematical term are precise, but the answers prohibited are not
2. the nature of mathematics is objective or scientific, but the answers prohibited are not
3. Socrates gave a poor defense by saying there's nothing prevent it from being similar.



# Why Socrates used the mathematical analogy?
Socrates is suggesting the form of justice

> Is there really a "form of justice"?

Mathematical knowledge is different from forms, but it belongs to "true being" and is based on reason rather than the senses.

The answers Thrasymachus prohibited are vacuous because they are abstract, and Thrasymachus thinks abstract concepts are not appropriate for discussing justice because justice needs to be concrete and practical.

## Meaning 1: The answers are useful

Socrates' answer lead us to think why "$2 \times 6 = 12$" is useful but "justice is advantageous" is not. 

Welton thinks in the mathematical is easier to apply to empirical world, but justice seems more difficult. This reveals the gap between the reality of Forms and the world of Becoming. Thus, Socrates (or Plato) is actually arguing that the prohibited answers are useful not for applying to the world of Becoming, but to the world of Forms.

We arrive at "mathematical purification" by "abstraction" or "recollection", and this is the process of purifying concepts into forms.

The instances of abstraction in Republic:

1. The ruler in the precise speech 
2. The money-making art
3. just city in speech
4. various types of politeiai and psychai

Mathematical knowledge is useful.

**Conclusion**: Therefore, here, Socrates is trying to explain why the forms are useful by offering a mathematical analogy.

## Meaning 2: there could be more than one answer

For "what is twelve", the answers Socrates provide are equally true.
Socrates may also suggest Thrasymachus has prohibited all the right answer

> This has obviously gone too far.

## Meaning 3: If we don't know how to apply forms, then we don't know forms

the definitions are vacuous because we do not know who to apply them in the real world. The debate between Thrasymachus is exactly about how should we apply the term "advantageous" to the real world.

## Meaning 4: The relationship between definition and Form

It is generally assumed that the definition, for Plato, is to reveal the relationship between the structure of a Form. But in Plato's dialogue, no definition are successful, presumably because Forms cannot be adequately expressed in language. (see [[@hylandFinitudeTranscendencePlatonic1995]], 165-95; [[@gonzalezDialecticDialoguePlato1998]], 245-74) 

Thus, this analogy shows that the concept "twelve" transcends all the proper definition like "$3 \times 4$" or "$2 \times 6$" and cannot be uniquely expressed by a single definition, but the former cannot be fully reduced to any of its diverse manifestations.

# The meaning of another analogy: the advantage of the stronger and the advantage

Socrates blame Thrasymachus for using the prohibited definition of "justice is the advantage", but Thrasymachus think it makes a big difference, but Socrates replies it is not clear there is any. Thus Socrates thinks:

1. 12 is $2 \times 6$
2. Justice is the advantageous
3. Justice is the advantageous of the stronger

1 and 2 are similar, and 2 and 3 are similar. The order of 1, 2 and 3 is the order of abstractness, and 1 is useful and true. By claim this, Socrates makes an interesting point that **What is the reason that Thrasymachus thinks 2 and 3 are different?** If 2 is vacuous, then what makes 3 less vacuous, since the word "advantageous" is too abstract or empty for a proper definition?

Welton thinks that if one does not know what's "advantageous" in the first place and thereby considering it as vague, then how it become clearer when someone says "the advantage of the stronger"?

Socrates' refutation that "the beef is advantageous to Polydamus, and is also advantageous to us" infers that Thrasymachus' definition is still too generalized, which he thinks the prohibited definitions are, in three aspects: 

1. What does he mean "the stronger"? Is it physical?
2. What does he mean "advantage"? Is it something like health?
3. What does he mean "the advantage of the stronger"? Does he mean that all the people should all take the stronger as the model and share his advantage? 

Therefore, Thrasymachus' claim does not meet up his own requirement for a proper definition.

> For 3, actually yes. Thrasymachus does imply that the intellect ones should do that.
> And Thrasymachus can claim that his prohibition means that there is nor shared objective value for all.


**conclusion**: It is wrong trying to think a definition should be free of abstraction because it is both impossible and not helpful because one cannot understand a particular if he does not understand the universal (If one does not understand what advantage is, then he cannot not understand someone's advantage). The correct way of giving definition is to understand the general terms in the right way.
