# 1. Thrasymachus is not giving a definition but debunking the custom view
Thrasymachus is debunking the standard effects of justice instead of redefining justice. The agreed premise is justice is to obey the law.

This is because Thrasymachus waffles on the question of why anyone is just. Someone seems to be just because of high-minded innocence, but some are just pretending to be just and being hypocrisy because they are afraid of penalty.

## 1.1 Two possible challenge:
Callicles' perspective: revise the scope of the term
Thrasymachus' perspective: reevaluate its value

## 1.2 Thrasymachus' premises:
1. advantage, good and happiness "must be understood in worldly terms, and in particular as a function of money and power"
2. There is no common good. For one to have more means for others to have less.
3. Everyone is motivated by pleonexia, the drive to have more of these goods

## 1.3 Problems on Thrasymachus' premise 

By restricting the good as wealth and power, he ignores that
1. there could be psychological effects of justice that is 
	- good in itself, or
	- it can help people deal with family or social relationship, or how it affects our relations to the gods, and
2. there could be other goods that matters

## 1.4 Ruler in the Strict Sense 
Plato uses Thrasymachus to introduce the concept that "ruling is a craft"

# 2. Socrates' Refutation of Thrasymachus
General conclusion:
Socrates' refutation is 
1. a systematic to undermine Thrasymachus' attack on justice, and
2. establishes the opposed position that justice makes us happy

## 2.1 The "nature of craft" argument
Thrasymachus' counterexample: shepherd
Socrates refuses to budge and therefore it runs into a stalemate

Barney: 
This is the dilemma we see today: in the craft of journalism, proprietors, publishers and the investors take Thrasymachean view, while most journalists hold the Socratic view.

## 2.2 The "wage-earning" argument
The telling point of this argument: If crafts were beneficial to their practitioners, why would they get paid?

The problem of it: for the wage-earning craft to fit the previous conclusion, it would have to somehow benefit the wages themselves.

## 2.3 The "non-pleonectic" argument
"The most confusing and least satisfactory of the whole series"
1. It's dubious that the craft-practitioners are not competitive with each other.
2. it's odd to describe the non-expert who fails to hit the mean as "acting pleonectically".

Barney:
To draw attention between the contrast between a genuine craft-practitioner and one corrupted by pleonexia. 
Thrasymachus made a mistake in assenting to it.

## 2.4 The "gang-of-thieves" argument

The problem: 
The analogy from groups to individuals requires a large unstated assumption that
1. our soul have three parts, and that
2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">it is unclear what it would mean for psychological parts to practice justice</mark>, and that
3. It might lead to infinite regression
Also, Plato yet has not explained why would a internally just person behave justly externally.

> yes, what does it mean for psychological parts to practice justice?

## 2.5 The "function" argument

it is based on the conclusion that justice is a virtue from 3.3, which is dubious

## 2.6 The major problem of Socrates' arguments:
1. leans heavily on induction over a few examples, which is undermined by wage-earning craft. (1,2)
2. It is unclear how justice in the soul operates the same way as it does in the society. (4)
3. Argument 5 relies on the conclusion of argument 3, but argument 3 is dubious. (3,5)

# 3. Conclusions:
**Different understandings about Book I**
1. A trailer for the arguments to come:
the ideal of the "real ruler", the understanding of justice as what unifies and empowers

2. Deliberate exercise in failure:
to illustrate the need for a different method with different interlocutors
(radical view: Book I and the remaining books are written separately)

**Barney:**
displayed some important information about justice, notably unifying, craft-like, the virtue of the soul, and it is what enables us to live happily. 

However, it does not tell us what justice consists in or essentially is and therefore not showing in a convincing way how it is able to do these things.

The two views are all correct in some extent, and Book I is on the way to the first principles.
