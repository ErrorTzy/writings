## 1.1 On Plato

### 1.1.1 Biography

Beyond the historical fact that Plato was born around 428 BC and died around 348 BC, nearly everything about Plato is the subject of debate. Yet what is widely accepted is that, unlike Aristotle, whose public writings have been lost while his academic teachings have survived, we only have access to Plato's public writings. None of the works from within Plato's academy have been preserved. Furthermore, among the works that have been preserved, it is generally believed that some are authentic, some are spurious, and the authenticity of others is still debated.

One intriguing aspect of Plato's life, as per the seventh letter—whose authenticity is questioned but generally deemed genuine—is his association with the city of Syracuse. Plato visited Syracuse three times in an attempt to mold the tyrant Dionysus into a philosopher king. Despite his best efforts, these attempts ended in failure. Plato's first visit to Syracuse occurred when Dionysius the Elder was in power, and it ended in failure due to political intrigue. The second and third visits took place during the reign of Dionysius the Younger, who initially showed interest in Plato's teachings but ultimately proved resistant to philosophical rule. Plato's attempts to instill philosophical wisdom in Dionysius ended in disappointment, and he even faced danger and temporary imprisonment.

## 1.2 On Studies of Plato
Please note that the following approaches represent only a few notable and basic classifications for conducting research on Plato. However, many studies adopt more than one approach or remain neutral.

### 1.2.1 Strauss School

The Strauss School of political philosophy was initiated by Leo Strauss (1899-1973), a German-American political philosopher. The Straussian approach has gained significant popularity within Chinese academic circles over the past 50 years, largely due to the introductions provided by 甘阳 and 刘小枫.

Advocates of the Strauss School believe that there is timeless wisdom embedded within the "Great Books", particularly those of ancient authors like Plato and Aristotle. This belief contrasts with the views held by the Cambridge School. Moreover, Straussians employ a method known as "esoteric reading", which posits that ancient authors often concealed their true meanings within the text to avoid persecution. Consequently, Straussians seek to unearth meanings that are not explicitly presented in the text.

Given this interpretive approach and their particular political standpoint, the Strauss School has been a subject of controversy. Nevertheless, it remains a highly influential school of thought in the field of political philosophy.

### 1.2.2 Analytical Approach
The analytical approach is how analytical philosophy tackles Plato's dialogues. It's challenging to summarize their overarching ideas, as this approach is essentially defined by its analytical style of text analysis rather than any shared conclusions. Nevertheless, there are some commonalities. Practitioners of the analytical approach tend to extract arguments from Plato's Republic and apply them to contemporary topics. In doing so, they may overlook arguments considered trivial or non-philosophical, even though these might play a significant role in Platonic philosophy.

### 1.2.3 Tübingen School
The teachings from Plato's Academy are largely lost to history, or perhaps they were never written down to begin with. This leaves Plato's true philosophical beliefs shrouded in mystery, given that he didn't explicitly identify any of the ideas presented in his dialogues as his own. The Tübingen School represents one approach to unraveling this enigma, focusing on the potential esoteric oral teachings of Plato.

The Tübingen School's approach is based on a careful interpretation of both the dialogues and the testimonies of ancient scholars who had access to the oral tradition of the Academy. For instance, the School places great importance on the testimony of Aristotle, who was a student at the Academy and referenced Plato's unwritten doctrines in his own work.

However, the Tübingen School's interpretation of Plato has been controversial. Critics argue that the unwritten doctrines and the systemic reading of the dialogues are speculative and lack solid evidence. Nonetheless, the Tübingen School's work has significantly shaped the contemporary understanding of Plato's philosophy and continues to be influential in Platonic studies.

#### 1.2.3.1 Further Reading on the Tübingen School's Studies
The Tübingen School has largely published in German and Italian, with some of the most significant works by its members not yet available in English. I therefore do not know any Tübingen school's studies typically focusing on Plato's republic. However, <a href="https://cloud.shisu.edu.cn:443/link/CA4054360F2021C3D289B2E487AECAFB">Thomas A. Szlezák's Reading Plato</a> provides an overview for Tübingen School's approach.

### 1.2.4 Cambridge School
The Cambridge School of political philosophy adopts a context-centric approach to understanding the works of philosophers, placing great emphasis on the historical, cultural, and political circumstances surrounding the creation of these works. The school posits that philosophical ideas were largely formulated as responses to the specific political situations and dominant ideologies of their respective times. This approach contrasts sharply with the Strauss School, which sees certain texts, including Plato's dialogues, as containing timeless truth. 

The Cambridge School's approach to Plato includes a careful study of the complexities of Athenian democracy, the Peloponnesian War, and the broader cultural and intellectual currents of Plato's era. This perspective provides a rich, textured reading of Plato's works that underscores their immediacy and historical specificity. 

However, this approach is not prevalent in classical studies, given most historical materials has lost due to the long passage of time. The Cambridge School's primary focus tends to be on the historical and political context of more recent philosophers (i.e., those since the 17th century).

### 1.2.5 Neoplatonism
Neo-Platonism is a school of thought that emerged in the 3rd century AD, hundreds of years after Plato's death. Despite the time gap, Neo-Platonists saw themselves as the true successors to Plato's philosophy and aimed to synthesize Platonic ideas with religious and mystical beliefs.

Neo-Platonists tend to view Plato's dialogues not just as philosophical texts, but also as mystical or spiritual guidebooks. They often interpret Plato's works in an allegorical or symbolic manner, emphasizing themes of unity, transcendence, and the journey of the soul. They argue that the ultimate goal of human life, as suggested in Plato's works, is to achieve unity with 'the One,' a concept that represents the ultimate reality or divine source.

Neo-Platonist interpretations have been influential in many early readings of Plato, including in the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic philosophical traditions. However, they've also been critiqued for projecting later philosophical and religious ideas onto Plato's original texts.

### 1.3.2 On the dialogue

#### 1.3.2.1 The Dramatic Date
The dramatic dating of Plato's Republic is subject to two widely accepted possibilities: 410 B.C. or 421-422 B.C.[^1]. Also, the precise period when Plato wrote this dialogue remains uncertain, with scholarly consensus leaning towards 380-370 B.C. Despite the ambiguity of these details, one aspect is undeniably clear: there is a significant gap spanning several decades between the setting of the dialogue and the time when Plato wrote it. Consequently, we can assert with confidence that the historical context plays an instrumental role in interpreting the Republic.

The dramatic setting unfolds amidst the backdrop of the Peloponnesian war. If we adopt 421-422 B.C. as the dramatic date, roughly corresponding to the Peace of Nicias, the tone of the dialogue would likely be optimistic and perhaps even pragmatic. This is because, during this period, the Athenians were at the zenith of their power. On the other hand, if we consider 410 B.C., after the aftermath of the Sicilian Expedition, the tone would veer towards the realm of the speculative or even imaginary, given that the Athenians were on the brink of losing the war. Nevertheless, a third perspective suggests that Plato may have intentionally left the dramatic date vague. The only crucial detail to comprehend would be that the dialogue is set during the Peloponnesian War. 

Regardless, the specific dramatic date of Plato's Republic is a relatively minor concern in our analysis. While it may not warrant excessive emphasis, maintaining awareness of these temporal nuances could potentially enhance our understanding of the work.

#### 1.3.2.2 The Peloponnesian War

The Peloponnesian War, fought from 431 to 404 B.C., was primarily between the polis of Athens and Sparta and their respective allies. The conflict is generally divided into three phases. The Archidamian War (431-421 B.C.) was basically a draw. A brief peace (the Peace of Nicias) was agreed upon in 421 B.C. but failed to hold. The second phase, the Sicilian Expedition (415-413 B.C.), involved a disastrous Athenian military expedition to Sicily. This phase significantly weakened Athens and shifted the balance of power. The final phase, the Decelean War or the Ionian War (413-404 B.C.), culminated in Sparta's victory with Persian support. 

After the Peloponnesian War, Sparta, the victor, established the rule of the Thirty Tyrants in Athens in 404 B.C. This was an oligarchic regime consisting of thirty Athenian aristocrats, with Critias (which is Plato's uncle) and Theramenes being the most notable among them. Sparta's aim was to keep Athens weak and divided, so it couldn't pose a threat to Spartan hegemony. The rule of the Thirty Tyrants was characterized by harsh and repressive measures. They initiated a purge, executing and exiling many Athenians in order to seize their wealth and consolidate power. However, this brutal regime was short-lived. It was internally divided, with significant disagreements between more moderate members, like Theramenes, and extremists like Critias. After a series of battles, and with growing support from the Athenian population, Thrasybulus and his forces managed to overthrow the Thirty Tyrants and recovered democracy in 403 B.C, which followed by the trail of Socrates in 399 B.C..

The Peloponnesian War had profound effects on Greek city-states, leading to the downfall of the Athenian Empire and significantly weakening the overall power of the Hellenic world. This period of instability and decline foreshadowed the eventual fall of the Hellenic world, setting the stage for the rise of the Roman Empire later.

### 1.3.3 On the characters
Our understanding of the characters appearing in the Republic, as well as in other dialogues, is limited due to the sparse historical resources available to construct comprehensive biographies. However, we do possess some critical information about these figures. For instance, Glaucon and Adeimantus are acknowledged to be Plato's brothers according to Diogenes Laertius (III.1). Further, certain details about the household of Polemarchus have been preserved[^2]. Cephalus, a metic[^3] from Syracuse, amassed considerable wealth through his engagement in shield merchandising and Polemarchus, Euthydemus and Lysias are his children. During the rule of the Thirty Tyrants, Cephalus' wealth was confiscated, and Polemarchus was executed without charge.

# 2. Plato's Republic
## 2.1 Book I
### 2.1.1 The Opening Scene (327a-328b)
#### 2.1.1.1 Socrates's introduction(327a)
Socrates went down to the Piraeus with Glaucon, son of Ariston
intention: pray to the goddess(Bendis, 354a)
reason: they were now holding it for the first time (: curiosity? piety?)

Socrates' comment on the festival:
The native's procession was fine, but the Thracians was no less good.
> Comments:
> The collaboration between natives and foreigners under the name of religious rite, a higher, holier power.
> 
> - Background information on Bendis and Bendideia:
> Bendis, a Thracian goddess, shares certain similarities with the renowned Artemis of the ancient Hellenic world. Her iconography often aligns with that of Artemis, showcasing her as a huntress. Additionally, another depiction of Bendis characterizes her as the "Great Mother", embodying facets of fertility, matrimony, and childbirth, as well as a broader association with nature, including animals and plants. Consequently, Bendis can fundamentally be associated with hunting, nature, and fertility[^4].
> The integration of Bendis into Athenian theology was a strategic diplomatic move. Amid the Peloponnesian war, Athens and Thrace formed alliances, and the incorporation of a foreign deity into Athens symbolized their camaraderie. This type of political maneuver was not uncommon in the Hellenic world.
> The Bendideia festival mentioned by Plato can be divided into two segments. Initially, the devotees of Bendis embarked on a six-mile march from Athens to the sanctuary in Piraeus. Subsequently, the Thracians in Piraeus would connect the procession from the city to the sanctuary.
>

####  2.1.1.2 Polemarchus' command(327b-328b)
##### 2.1.1.2.1 Slave boy's order(327b)
Polemarchus orders the slave boy, the slave boy orders Socrates and Glaucon.
> The slave boy indicates Polemarchus is a man of power. In addition, Socrates remained silent, but Glaucon agrees to wait. This reflected Glaucon's character that he is more submissive to power, and therefore more like a citizen who obeys higher command?

##### 2.1.1.2.2 Conflict between Polemarchus and Socrates(327c)

Socrates' side: Socrates, Glaucon
Polemarchus' side: Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus, son of Nicias and some others, coming from the procession.

Polemarchus: stronger(κρείσσων) ones commands the weaker ones, there is no use for the weak to persuade.
> Again, Glaucon is willing to admit there is no other way, while Socrates remained silent. 
> 
> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Q: 
 1. Why Socrates remained silent? Is there really no other way for philosophers to get out of such situation? 
 2. Why Glaucon was on Socrates' side, while Adeimantus was on Polemarchus' side?</mark>


##### 2.1.1.2.3 De-escalation by Adeimantus(328a-b)
Adeimantus: persuaded Socrates to stay and watch the torch race on horse back for the goddess. Polemarchus and Socrates all considered this proposal acceptable.
> Comments:
> Once again, Religious activity provided a common interest for Socrates and Polemarchus, who were called "the powerless wise and unwise power" by Allan Bloom in the interpretive essay, despite possibly different motives.

### 2.1.2 Cephalus' Justice(328b-331d)
In Polemarchus' home:
Polemarchus' brothers: Lysias, Euthydemus
The sophist: Thrasymachus the Chalcedonian
Unknown: Charmantides the Paenian 
Politician: Cleitophon[^5]
#### 2.1.2.1 Cephalus' welcome(328b-328c)
Cephalus entered the scene with a wreath and having just performed a sacrifice in the court yard. He asked Socrates to come to him more frequently because his bodily pleasure has gone while he starts to have a desire of speech.
> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Q: What was Cephalus' desire of speech exactly?</mark>

The reason for his request asking Socrates to come is that,

1. He wants to talk to Socrates, but
2. He does not have the strength to make the trip to Socrates

$\therefore$ Socrates ought to come to him

Although his tone was rather friendly, his arguments denote that he thinks his desire can derive other people's duty.

However, instead of admitting that he was trying to satisfy Cephalus' needs, Socrates gives another reason for talking with Cephalus:

1. If someone will probably take some road, then he ought to learn what sort the road is of.
2. Socrates and other people will probably take the road of old age.

$\therefore$ Socrates and other people ought to learn what sort of road old age is of.

Socrates placed his obligation at the obligation of understanding the potential future life instead of Cephalus' desire. 

> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Why would Socrates think it is an obligation to understand future life? </mark>

#### 2.1.2.2 Cephalus' arguments on why old life is good(329a-d)

First Cephalus displayed two arguments of others:

A. Most of us (πλεῖστοι ἡμῶν):

1. If and only if someone enjoys bodily pleasure, he lives well
2. Most of us do not enjoy bodily pleasure because of old age.

$\therefore$ Most of us do not live well because of old age.

B. Some:

1. If someone is abused by his relatives, then he was harmed by evil
2. If someone is harmed by evil, then he does not live well
3. Some old men are abused by their relatives because of old age.

$\therefore$ Some old men do not live well because of old age.

And then Cephalus refuted the argument for the reason that:

In A, A1 is false because Sophocles enjoys, in contrary, being freed from bodily pleasure. Cephalus argues that:

1. If some is freed from bodily pleasure, then he gets peace and freedom.
2. If someone is in old age, then it is possible for someone to be freed from bodily pleasure

$\therefore$ If someone is in old age, then it is possible that he gets peace and freedom

And in B, they are abused not because they are old, therefore old age is not culpable for not living well. The real cause is their character. Cephalus argues that:

1. If someone is orderly and content with themselves, then old age is only moderately troublesome, and
2. if someone is not orderly and content with themselves, then old age and young age are both hard.

> The odd part is his second part of his argument. He explicitly stated that he was addressing the opinion concerning relatives (329d), but it is unclear why if someone is orderly and content with themselves then the problem of abuse is solved. If we read with charity, we can try to assume that Cephalus is trying to say that
> 
> 1. if someone is orderly and content with themselves, then he have internal peace
> 2. If someone have internal peace and is abused by relatives, then it is only moderately troublesome
> 
> Old age is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one. From the argument we added, we can deduce that if someone is orderly and content as well as in old age, then he gets peace and freedom. Clearly Cephalus is implying that he is orderly (which means he does not indulge himself in bodily pleasure) and content with himself (which implies he does not care too much about if he is content with others, as well as being content with the wanting of strength). But the problem is, his argument is not constructive advice for those who don't live well, for they do think bodily pleasure is important for a good life and being harmed by evil is an intolerable thing. Therefore, question about what makes he be orderly and content with himself should be raised, and Socrates doubted if his order and contention was from money or from character.
> If we look deeper on Cephalus' argument, we can see his second part is still problematic even if we added our argument for charity. If someone severely abused, it is very hard to say he is still in peace. Cephalus, for he is the master of the house and possess great wealth, is not likely to be abused, and he is rather indifferent to this problem. The wealth is at least one of the sources of his authority. 
> Also, if someone is in poverty, he is not likely to have an orderly life, because he is powerless and not able to sustain his own daily life and he does not have wealth to feed himself, which makes it hard to maintain any kind of order. 
> Thus, if someone is poor, Cephalus' argument can not apply to him, especially the latter. And if someone is kind of well-off but not that wealthy, then Cephalus' first refutation might apply, but since he does not have the authority from his wealth, the second refutation might fall.

Socrates' doubt: Was this orderly and content life caused by character, or by substance(οὐσία)?

#### 2.1.2.3 Cephalus' arguments on money and character(329e-330c)
##### 2.1.2.3.1 Money and character are both important(329e-330a)
Cephalus argues that:

1. If someone has decent character and not wealthy, then he bears old age with difficulty;
2. If someone does not have decent character and is wealthy, then he is not content with himself.

He used Themistocles as an authority, although what Themistocles' argument does not logically connected with Cephalus' argument.

> Cephalus did not mention the orderly-life part, and thus we can deduct that the most important part is about self-content. The lines of reason should be:
> 
> 1. If someone is content with himself, then he is satisfied with not being able to enjoy bodily pleasure, and he can tolerate the abuse.
> 2. If someone is orderly, then he do not engage in bodily pleasure to begin with.
> 3. If someone does not engage bodily pleasure to begin with, then he is satisfied with not being able to enjoy bodily pleasure.
> 
> Being orderly is not a necessary condition for having a good old age, since if someone is content with oneself, then he can achieve peace and freedom. From this we can also say that the text implies Cephalus did not have a orderly life when he was in his youth.
> 
> In Cephalus' argument, wealth and character are both necessary conditions. Although he argues with a strong tone by appealing to the authority of Themistocles, he in fact retreated from his previous position that a good character, namely Cephalus' character, is the sole cause of a good old life. Basically Cephalus was saying that his good old life is only achievable through having great wealth, but there is still a necessary factor, that is character. Then how should one have such character is to be questioned.


##### 2.1.2.3.2 Being the mean between money maker and money inheritor(330b-c)

Socrates' argument: 

1. If someone makes their own money, they are likely to see money as his own product.
2. If someone sees money as his own product, he will be overly fond of money.
3. If someone is overly fond of money, then they praise nothing other than money.
4. If someone praise nothing other than money, then they are hard even to be with (χαλεποὶ οὖν καὶ συγγενέσθαι εἰσίν).

He also mentioned that poets also applies to these lines of reasoning.

>Socrates' argument 4 does not follows that he does not have a good old age. It is possible for someone to put all his passion in money itself and find some kind of peace, and so are the poets. Therefore, the problem is not that they do not have a good life, but they are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">hard to be with</mark>, even if they are content with themselves and leads an orderly life. Socrates did not give us reason why he thought being hard to be with is not a good thing,
>But if we accept this as a premise, then we can deduce that:
>1. If someone wealthy made them all by himself, then he is likely to be hard to be with
>2. If someone wealthy did not made any money by himself, then he is likely to be lavish
>3. Being hard to be with and being lavish are not good.
>For 1, the reason is that he is overly fond of possessing money, and for 2, the reason is that he is overly fond of using money. Thus, to achieve the best way of deposing money, one need to find the mean, and thereby one should inherit some money as well as making money for himself. The answer has already lied in Socrates' question.
>
>(In addition, we can also see an interesting conclusion that Plato supports inheriting legacy.)

Cephalus' grandfather: 
- inherited 1, increased it many times over
Cephalus' father: 
- inherited many times over, decreased it less than 1 
Cephalus: 
- inherited less than 1, made it to 1 and passing it to his sons


#### 2.1.2.4 Cephalus' arguments on just and holy life(330c-331d)
> Now that Cephalus' good old life is explained: one needs to have internal peace and find the mean of making and inheriting money. Now the problem is that, why wealth is so important in Cephalus' definition? Therefore question on what wealth did to Cephalus so that he thought a good old life must be comprised of wealth arises. That is to say, the question moved from "how to have a good old life" to "what is a good old life", so that we can evaluate if Cephalus' belief on how to have a good old life is true.

Cephalus argues that:

1. If someone comes near to the realization of death, then he believes that if he has done unjust deeds then he will pay penalty.
(Cephalus also argues that, if someone is young, then he does not believe that if he has done unjust deeds then he will pay penalty)
2. If someone has done unjust deeds and comes near to the realization of death, then he fears the penalty afterlife.
3. If someone lives a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">just</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">holy</mark> life and comes near to the realization of death, then he does not fear the penalty afterlife.
4. If someone possess enough money, then it will help him to
	1. not cheating or lying to any man against his will
	2. not afraid of owing sacrifice to a god or money to a man when going to afterlife
	3. and many other things
5. If 4.1 and 4.2, then he lives a just and holy life

$\therefore$ If someone possesses enough money, then it will help him to not fearing the penalty afterlife.

> From these lines of reasoning, we can see Cephalus' definition of just and holy life is as follows:
> 
> 1. not cheating or lying to any man against his will
> 2. not owing sacrifice to a god or 
> 3. not owing money to a man.
> 
> The second part is the holy part or the justice for the afterlife, and the first and the third part, albeit the end of which are for gods, are nevertheless for the justice to this life. Despite this separation, all the activities are for afterlife. Justice in Cephalus' understanding, will not make any sense if the tales about afterlife penalty does not exist.
> It is curious why Cephalus added the first part, which is not cheating or lying to any man against his will. One way to explain this is that, the second part depended on the first part. If some owing relationship was established, then it must be based on some kind of agreement. Telling truth is about establishing agreement, and returning sacrifice to gods or money to men is about sticking to the agreement. Another possibility for explaining this is that, not cheating means not tricking money out of other people's pockets.
> 
> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Character vs. Justice</mark>
> According to Cephalus, the need for having a just and holy life will only emerge when one is old, while the decent and orderly character is the constant thing through out his life. Comparing with the character, which gives Cephalus a, relatively speaking, good life this life, the end of Cephalus' justice is in the afterlife. Therefore, his justice comes with holiness, because the end of justice is to ingratiate gods and thereby avoiding penalties. His good character helps him to find the mean of managing money, but it did not help him to get rid of the mad masters of desires. Justice and holiness come only when he was old, and if there is not such tale in the nomos of ancient Greek , he will probably not care about the penalty and thus justice and holiness. 
> 
> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Problem of nomos</mark>
> Cephalus' recount renders the problem of nomos: young people, who are capable of doing unjust deeds, will laugh at it, and old people will stick to it but generally they do not have the strength to do unjust deeds to begin with. It is unknown if Cephalus' good character is born with or in fact shaped by the nomos, but it is certain that nomos has very limited power to lead young people to justice. 
> 
> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The problem of worrying the future</mark>
> Another thing worth mentioning is that, when Socrates asked about old age, he is worrying about old age; and when Cephalus was talking about justice, he is worrying about the only possible afterlife. Worrying about the future is the motive of this philosophical discussion with Cephalus. It might construct the refutation to the life that enjoys bodily pleasure, since the capacity of satisfying bodily desire might be lost in the old age. Moreover, since the strength in the body will fade away when people grow old, they cannot fight against other people if he did unjust deeds and was revenged.

##### 2.1.2.4.1 Socrates' counterexample and restatement(331c-d)

Counterexample: Suppose you have a friend and you borrowed a deadly weapon from him he was sane, but he requires you to return the weapon when he becomes insane. 

The restatement of the definition:
Justice is speaking the truth and giving back what one takes.

> According to Cephalus' definition, it would be just to return the weapon to the insane friend. However, by doing so, it is likely to cause bad consequences. If someone accepts the principle that
> 
> If
> 	1. One believes that doing A causes B, and
> 	2. One believes that B is bad,
> then it is unjust for one to do A
> 
> then this contradicts Cephalus' definition of justice.
> 
> However, this reconstruction of the argument omitted the details of B, which is giving a mad friend a weapon. There are two aspects to consider here.
> On the one hand, Socrates thinks having friends around is an important component for a good life. Therefore, if someone should have friends, then he cannot simply adopt Cephalus' view, since human relationship consists some extent of unconditional sacrifice instead of calculating everything as debts and paying debts. Cephalus' definition is too cold for human relationship, and neglected the emotional bond between people, especially friends.
> On the other hand, there's a shift from doing good to oneself only, to doing good to others. Cephalus' definition of justice is a selfish one, because the only reason he wants justice is to avoid his own penalty. But in the counterexample, Socrates is kindly reminding Cephalus that, shouldn't you also do good to others, like your friends? The obligation of doing good to friends is related to the first aspect, and it is testified by Cephalus when he asked Socrates to come to his place more frequently -- obviously he needs friends. Therefore, if someone needs friends, then he cannot defend himself that having the solely selfish definition of justice will suffice. 
> 
> An important thing to notice is that, Cephalus never claimed that he gave any definition of justice. He was only describing the benefit of having money. Socrates extracted the definition from his account, and he obviously omitted the holy part. With this modification, he was actually turning the justice from afterlife to this life, since the original definition will not do any good if there is no afterlife penalty, but Socrates think justice should itself be good.

### 2.1.3 Polemarchus' Justice(331e-336a)

#### 2.1.3.1 What Is Owing and What Is Fitting(331e-332d)

Polemarchus interrupts, believing Cephalus' definition is right because Simonides said "It is just to give to each what is owed". 

> Although it is not a definition but an instance of what is just, and it could be a refutation to Socrates' counterexample, although not very valid. But it do reflected that Polemarchus is someone who is not good at philosophy and like to appeal to authority. Anyway, Polemarchus took it as a definition in the further argument. Therefore, although Polemarchus is the "heir of Cephalus' argument", the first thing he did was abandoning the part about "speaking the truth".


Socrates: To give everyone what is fitting
Polemarchus: To give benefits to friends and harms to enemies.


> Frist, Polemarchus adopted Socrates counter example, but he only adopted it to the range of friends instead of all other people. Comparing with Polemarchus' definition of enemy, that is someone, to whom we should give the harm back, gave you harm previously, then the definition of friend should be the one who gave you someone good previously, and hence you should give good back. 
> However there is a subtle problem which leads to eventual failure of Polemarchus' definition. In this definition of friend and enemy, instead of bad, the opposite of good is harm, which means good should not cause any harm. In addition, the meaning of good is benefits. Therefore, the premise Polemarchus accepted is that:
> 
> 1. To benefit is good.
> 2. To harm is bad.
> 
> To put the problem aside for now, another premise is yet more troublesome. Polemarchus accepts that:
> 
> 3. Good is fitting for friends.
> 4. Bad is fitting for enemies.
> 
> Therefore, there are 4 premises that have been adopted from the original definition Socrates concluded to Polemarchus' definition. 

#### 2.1.3.2 Useless Justice(332d-333d)
> Now Socrates is tricking Polemarchus into another premise that justice is an art that gives what is fitting, as if justice was something productive. However, justice is about judging what is the right thing to give instead of giving the thing. Knowing what is fitting is the right answer to Socrates' question, but Polemarchus might be too focused on giving benefits to friends. 

332c-d: What is the art of justice
1. the art of medicine - give bodies drugs, food and drinks
2. the art of cooking - give seasonings to meats
3. the art of justice - give benefits and harms to friends and enemies

> In this part, Polemarchus answer has already deviated from what is in Socrates' mind. The art of medicine and cooking should be the knowledge of knowing how in the first place: knowing how to give bodies drugs, food and drinks and knowing how to give seasonings to meats. However, there is still a problem with this analogy. The good of an art is evaluated by its product instead of the knowledge itself. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">However, can justice evaluated by the action of a person, since knowing what is fitting does not necessarily give the one the ability to provide the thing?</mark>
> Plato would think it's no, but Aristotle seems to disagree?

332d-332e: Justice at wartime 
1. doctor: sickness
2. pilot: the danger of the sea
3. justice: making war and being an ally

> In this part, as well as in later sections, we see that Polemarchus' true intention is to benefit friends. Harming enemies in battle is merely another means of providing these benefits. Since Polemarchus' intention is not to harm enemies, he will not accept that justice only plays its role in wartime. Therefore, he must further explain the role of justice in peacetime. The discussion of justice in war is thus temporarily set aside, but will soon be brought up again.

333a-333d: Justice at peace time
1. farming: acquisition of fruits
2. shoemaking: acquisition of shoes
3. justice: acquisition of contracts(P)/partnership(S)
	1. player of draughts: setting down draughts
	2. house builder: setting down bricks and stones
	4. harp player: playing harp
	5. just man: money matters
		1. buying and selling horse: expert on horses
		2. buying and selling ship: expert on ships
		3. justice: keeping money
Justice is only useful when money is useless

> Polemarchus is having difficulty providing a precise definition of the art of justice, primarily because it is not an art that inherently produces tangible outcomes. Contracts or partnerships do not clearly specify what is being given or exchanged. Eventually, Polemarchus must admit that the art of justice primarily pertains to monetary matters — which represent potential products without any form of actualization. 
> 
> Moreover, any actions are the result of knowledge, motive and physical conditions. The nature of technique is related to knowledge and physical ability because a good product depends on knowledge(or at least true believes) and physical conditions, but it have little to do with motive. For instance, one can still be a good cook even if he hates to cook, as long as he can cook well. The overall argument is that:
> 
> 1. For all technique x, if x is good, then x is useful.
> 2. Justice is not useful
> 3. Justice is good
> $\therefore$ Justice is not a technique
> 
> From previous analysis, we can tell that
> 
> 4. Justice are actions (to benefit friends and harm enemies/to keep money)
> 5. All actions are caused by the combination of knowledge, motive and physical conditions.
> 6. Justice (to keep money) does not contain knowledge and physical conditions.
> 7. There is good of justice.
> $\therefore$ The good of justice is caused by motive.
> 
> This reasoning also concur with the previous conclusion that justice can only be defined internally, since money is the potentiality of products. The motive is argued thusly.

#### 2.1.3.3 Justice Is an Art of Stealing(333e-334b)
> The problem of viewing justice as an useful art is that, it does not concern the motive. However, according to the previous conclusion, justice must be defined by motive if it is the property of action. Therefore, in this part, if we define justice by external behaviors only, then just people are also dangerous in a partnership, since people let them keep money. This reflect a trouble in Polemarchus' definition: why would anyone want justice, since it is only benefiting friends and harming enemies, without benefiting oneself? In the partnership in a city, a general may have control over the cities' property: soldiers, which can guard the city as well as turn against the city. So is the one who is in charge of the supply of grain. This shows that the definition is not sufficient for a polis, in that even those who are considered just are dangerous. However, Polemarchus still insist his position, probably because it is still a useful thing in practice and only have theoretical hazard. We may use emperical way to limit the risk. 
#### 2.1.3.4 Good Friends and Bad Enemies(334c-335a)
Socrates: it's just to harm the unjust and help the just
Polemarchus: Benefit friends if he is good and harm enemies if he is bad

> Polemarchus think to treat badly men who have done nothing unjust "seems to be bad"(334d), and he adjusted his definition. However, he did not directly adopt Socrates' advice, but still hold on to the concept of friends and enmies. According to Socrates' advice of revision, one should harm bad friends and benefit good enemies, which Polemarchus remains silent and doesn't mention how to deal with them. Hence we can say that Polemarchus does not want to harm friends, even if he is bad.  This also impies that Polemarchus is a man of community because he values the relationship between members in a community as an indispensable element in defining justice. Yet this does not mean that good is simply ignored. Polemarchus nevertheless accepted the revision.

#### 2.1.3.5 Virtue Should Not Be the Cause of Harm(335b-336a)
Socrates argument:

1. For all property x and for all y that is the target of the thing that have x, if the thing that have x harms y, then the thing that have x cause y to become y that have less good.
2. For all property x and for all y that is the target of the thing that have x, the thing that have x does not cause y to become y that have less x .
3. Justice is a kind of virtue and all virtues are good.
4. Justice is a property.

Therefore, the thing that have justice does not harm its target.

> This conclusion is valid, but premise 1 and premise 2 are highly controversial. For premise one, it depends on the definition of harm. In the context of the dialogue, Polemarchus' understanding of harm is supposed to be physical harm, but if that is so, then premise 1 is not sound because it is possible for people to become better in virtue if they are physically punished for unvirtuous deeds. Yet if the meaning of harm is more internal, i.e., harm the good of a person, then this argument is sound. 
> 
> While premise 1 can still be saved by reading with charity, premise 2 is more problematic. Socrates used 2 kinds of arguments to justify this proposition, but they are all questionable.
> 
> First, if someone is skillful at some technique, then he can still make others unskillful about that technique by giving them false belief. If we read with charity, we can add that if someone is using the technique, then it will not make other people have less knowledge about this technique. However, this causal relationship is still unclear. For example, if there are two different methods to play the harp, and they contradict each other. Then if someone is learning one way and watching another playing the harp without knowing that one's method contradicts his own, then he may be less skillful by this skilled player. Thus, this argument does not stand.
> (A defense: the harp player is still one step closer to the complete knowledge of playing a harp)
> 
> Second, a property can cause its opposite. For example, cold water can cause pure sulfuric acid to become hot. Although the coldness itself does not cause hot, but the thing that hascoldness can still to cause its opposite. However, we can still argue that good itself should not cause its opposite. Yet this still does not stand, since this causal relationship is not necessary. For instance, if I first look at someplace that is very bright, then I turn my sight to a darker place, then I will feel dark even if it is not that dark for other people. Thus we can say that brightness caused darkness. Also, we can argue that the brighter the sun, the darker the skin, in that the sun can tan our skin. Hence, this argument also does not stand.
> 
> Based on previous analysis, we may need to admit that Socrates' argument is flawed, and he simply adds the premise to justice: it should cause good. This can be seen as Plato's plan to defend Socrates, since Socrates is accused of "corrupting young people". Therefore he needs to prove that Socrates is just and if someone is just, he will not cause others to be just. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Yet due to the unsound argument here, we need to pay special attention to this and see if in the end, will the most just people, philosophers, in fact will cause bad or not.</mark>
> 
> In addition, there is one more thing needs mentioning. In the end, Socrates reveals that this definition is related to tyranny, which uncovers the political aspect of the dialogue. To benefit friends and harm enemies can make a polis powerful, since it is most useful during war. However, people did forget about justice and those who like Polemarchus would still admit that harming just people is bad. Therefore, even if this kind of polis can win unjust war for a time, they cannot keep being strong because justice is hard to be ignored. Also, we can already see the relationship between poets and politics. Polemarchus derived his definition from Simonides, which lead him to such a political definition. In this case, poets can be the supporters of tyranny, even if it may not be their intention.

### 2.1.4 Thrasymachus' Justice(336b-354c)
#### 2.1.4.1 The Entering of Thrasymachus(336b-338b)

> There isn't much to discuss regarding this segment: As usual, Socrates professes ignorance about the nature of justice, and he puts on a display of politeness, enticing his interlocutors to take the bait and provide their own definitions. One notable point is that Plato explains why Thrasymachus falls for Socrates' bait, even though he's aware of it. Plato suggests that Thrasymachus has a 'desire for discourse' and 'wants to prevail over Socrates.' This is how Socrates gains power in a conversation: by feigning vulnerability, he awakens others' desire to dominate, thus obtaining the power to question and steer the dialogue.

#### 2.1.4.2 The First definition(338c-342e)
##### 2.1.4.2.1 The advantage of the ruler(338c-339c)

Thrasymachus said "the just is nothing other than the advantage of the stronger". (1)

Socrates instantly asks Thrasymachus to elucidate what he actually means by saying that a beef is advantageous for both the stronger and the weaker. (2)

Thrasymachus therefore defines the stronger as the ruler, and what he says can be reconstructed as:

1. A democracy sets down laws for the advantage of democracy,
2. A tyranny sets down laws for the advantage of tyranny,

3. $\therefore$ The ruler sets down laws for the advantage of the ruler.

4. The rulers declare that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the law is just</mark>, and whoever breaks the law is unjust
5. The rulers are the stronger

$\therefore$  Justice is for the advantage of the stronger.(3)


> (1) Whether Thrasymachus is giving a serious definition is under dispute. Here, I think he is not giving a definition but a conclusion. His lines of reasoning for the first definition are that:
> 
> 1. It is just to do things according to the laws
> 2. If people do things according to the laws, then they are doing things for the advantage of the rulers.
> 3. The rulers are the stronger
> 
> $\therefore$ It is just to do things for the advantage of the stronger.
> 
> Therefore, he is only trying to make himself sound novel by saying that justice is the advantage of the stronger. In fact, he should have said that justice is to obey laws if he is trying to use precise speech. The merit of stating the conclusion in the first place is that it implies that justice is not good.
> 
> (2) In the instance of beef, Socrates is actually implying two propositions:
> 
> 1.  Justice is natural, like beef is to human.
> 2.  Justice is common to the stronger and the weaker.
> 
> The latter is more obvious, since if the advantage of the stronger is also the advantage of the weaker, Thrasymachus would not have said "the advantage of the stronger" but "the advantage of all men". And in the latter text, Thrasymachus indeed thinks that for the weaker, the advantage of the stronger is the advantage of someone else, and therefore he does not think there is a common good. Yet the first implication is more subtle. It seems to imply that what Thrasymachus thinks is not correct because he claims that justice is artificial and has no natural basis. Therefore, a valid way to refute Thrasymachus is to find the natural basis for justice. 
> 
> (3) By defining the stronger as ruler, there raises a question: what makes the stronger stronger, since it is not defined by physical strength? There are two possible answers: The rulers are stronger, either because
> 
> 1. they must be able to access the ruling power, or
> 2. they must be capable of seizing the power to themselves
> 
> For the first answer, Cross and Woozley mentioned that there could be a paradox: when there is a revolution, the rulers should be the stronger because they are the ones that are able to access the ruling power, yet they cannot defeat the ones that rebel, and this make the rulers the weaker. Yet this can be explained by claiming that when there is a revolution, the ruling group in fact is not able to get access of the ruling power, or at least they can rule less people then the rebel, and thus they are not the stronger. In this sense, the stronger are strictly speaking the rulers in power. This view also aligns with Thrasymachus' claim that those who are able to make laws and command the subject are the stronger, and if someone is not the one making laws or commanding, then even if he knows how to legislate, he is not the stronger because the law will not be advantageous to him. 
> The second answer enables someone to be strong even if he is not in fact ruling. This does not directly align with Thrasymachus' account, since if that is so, the law is not necessarily for the advantage of the stronger because the one who is capable of seizing power may be now on the way of seizing it instead of being a ruler. However, Thrasymachus does define the essence of a ruler as something internal, which is that a ruler is called a ruler not because he is in fact ruling, but he has the knowledge of ruling and he does not make mistakes. If Thrasymachus is consistent, then he should be claiming that the more fundamental reason is the internal knowledge, and this knowledge will inevitably cause someone to rule. In this case, Thrasymachus' account can be reconstructed as:
> 
> 1. If someone has the knowledge of ruling, then he rules.
> 2. If someone rules, then he is the stronger.
>  
> This in turn defines what kind of knowledge the knowledge of ruling is -- the kind of knowledge that ensures one can seize power and do what is best for himself. 


##### 2.1.4.2.2 Is Obeying Bad Laws Just? (339c-339e)

1. It is possible for a ruler to make a law that is disadvantageous for the ruler. 
2. x is just iff x obeys the law.
3. x is just iff x is the advantage of the stronger.
4. If a ruler makes a law that is disadvantage for the ruler, then the one who obeys it cause disadvantage to the ruler.

$\therefore$ It is possible for someone to be just and not just.

Cleitophon suggest Thrasymachus modify 3 in to:

- x is just iff x is believed by the stronger to be his advantage.

> Socrates thinks justice is also something advantageous, but not of the stronger.
> Cleitophon's suggestion is closer to Nietzche, since Nietzche thinks what is desired by will is what is good, instead of thinking that there is some objective good. However, this view seems especially implausible in the political realm, since politics is complicated and people can easily make a bad decision in political affairs if they does not have sufficient knowledge. But the main reason for Thrasymachus to reject Cleitophon's view is that he is taking a more intuitive and common view that the advantageous are to be specific wealth and power, and this is obviously objective -- after all Nietzsche's view asks us to bite the bullet when what our will desires turns out harmful, and what is more acceptable is Thrasymachus' view. 
> 
> <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Cleitophon's suggestion is not defining the stronger by knowledge but by power.</mark>

##### 2.1.4.2.3 the ruler in the strict sense(340a-341c)

However, Thrasymachus refuses to modify 3. Instead, he modified 1 and stated that a ruler by definition does not make mistake. Therefore, he claims that:

1. x is a ruler iff he makes laws that are advantage for the ruler.

$\therefore$ It is necessary a ruler to make a law that is advantage for the ruler

> It is a matter of dispute what Plato really want to say when he let Thrasymachus adopted this precise definition of ruler. 
> Cross and Woozley think this is merely a verbal patching because when a subject thinks a law is not serving the advantage of the stronger, he will still encounter the dilemma. This may even imply that the subject gets to choose what law to obey, which is obviously not what Thrasymachus mean. 
> However, this exactly shows that Thrasymachus is not really taking the advantage of the stronger as the real definition of justice. The real first definition of justice of him is to obey laws, and defining the ruler in the strict sense is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">in fact a regression</mark> from the previous stance that justice is always bad, to the stance that justice is sometimes bad, because what is good is one's own advantage and what's bad is to serve other's advantage, and justice is now only sometimes the advantage of the stronger. In this case, Thrasymachus is abandoning his first definition, because the gap between a ruler and a stronger has been torn apart by Socrates, and by his definition, which is that the stronger is called a stronger because he has knowledge and does not make mistakes, a stronger is no longer necessarily a ruler, which is different from what he claims at the beginning. Thrasymachus has to choose between a stronger and a ruler, and he chose the stronger, and he is only saying that a ruler should be what he describes as a "perfect ruler". Thus, Thrasymachus is no longer a sociological observer, but a moral philosopher.
> Despite the regression, what Thrasymachus is saying is plausible in itself. In 2.1.3.5, the example used by Socrates implies that is someone is a craftsman of an art, then he necessarily use this art. Also, Socrates accepted Thrasymachus' precise ruler without questioning, and this may indicate that this is what Plato actually agrees. In addition, we do call someone a doctor because he cure patients, and only if we add self-identity, we will think the one who is not curing patients is still a doctor, as long as he cured someone before. Therefore, Thrasymachus' account is plausible and even has lesser premises. 

##### 2.1.4.2.4 the argument from ends(341c-342e)

An art comes into being when something is defective, and the art is devised for the purpose of providing what is advantageous for it (medicine and body). Then Socrates raise a question: Can "something" here be an art?
And he lists three possible answers:

1. It can, and the art needs another art, and so on endlessly, or
2. It can, and the art itself considers its defect, or
3. It can't, and there is no defect present in any art, thereby not needing to seek any other advantage other than that of which it is the art

Thrasymachus agrees with the third one, and Socrates infers that, since

1. The body is that of which medicine is the art, and thus medicine only considers the advantage of the body.
2. The horses are that of which horsemanship is the art, and thus horsemanship only consider the advantage of horses.

$\therefore$ All arts only consider the advantage of their object, and since

3. the subjects are that of which the art of ruling is the art

$\therefore$  the art of ruling should only consider the subjects.


> Thrasymachus agrees with the third one, statement, as he cannot conceive that a perfect art could be still defective. If Thrasymachus thinks what a perfect art means is the infallible knowledge of that of which it is the art, then he indeed should accept this. 
> 
> The key issue is that the thing of which it is the art, in this case, is not what we think it is, since Socrates tells us that it is something defective and requires an art to improve it. In this case, it is the rulers themselves that are defective and need the ruling art to supplement their defects. Therefore, Thrasymachus should not have agreed that the object of ruling is the subjects. He accepts because he is not able to distinguish the different meaning of "the object of an art". In this case, if we read with charity, then there is no self-contradiction in Thrasymachus' view. Thrasymachus failed in the argument only because he agrees on some innocent-looking premises that in fact he should not have agreed. However, this does not in turn mean that Socrates is wrong. Socrates in this case, is not really refuting the internal contradiction in Thrasymachus' theory, but he is offering an alternative about the meaning of a ruler which is very different from Thrasymachus.
> 
> However, what's on Socrates' mind is much harder to understand. What Socrates says is almost embarrassingly silly and can be easily dismissed at first glance. He uses inductive reasoning to infer his argument, but the counterexamples are very easy to find. For instance, the art of fighting is obviously not seeking advantages for the opponent, and the art of hunting is obviously not seeking advantages for the prey. In addition, when he says that those who make money by using medicine are applying both the art of medicine and the art of wage earning, and if Socrates is consistent, he should say that the art of earning wages seeks the advantage of wage itself, not the advantage of the one who uses it, which is absurd. Therefore, his conclusion that all arts should only consider the advantage of their object makes no sense at all. 
> 
> Still, Socrates may answer this doubt. He has a special understanding about what an art is, which is that "the arts rule and are masters of that of which they are arts"(342c). Socrates also states that a doctor is "a ruler of bodies"(342d) and a pilot is "a ruler of sailors(341b)". Therefore, it seems that Socrates is rather using the ruling model to understand art, and uses the conclusion inferred from it back to ruling itself. In this case, Socrates is essentially saying that "Oh Thrasymachus, you should understand the ruler like a doctor or a pilot, instead of what's on your mind, perhaps a wage-earner, because the former ones have a ruling structure and they also deal with interpersonal relationship, therefore they resemble the art of ruling more than the latter". Thus, we may reconstruct Socrates' argument as follows:
> 
> 1. For all arts that rule x, x is that of which they are the arts. (because an art comes into being when x is defective and needs an art to be improved) 
> 2. All arts only consider the advantage of that of which they are the arts.
> 3. The art of ruling rules the subjects, and the subjects are that of which ruling is an art.
> 
> $\therefore$ The art of ruling considers the advantage of the subjects.
> 
> It seems that if an art has to rule something, it limits its range to the art of providing, because the arts of earning, like hunting, or wage-earning do not rule, but try to get hold of, their objects, namely prey or wealth. Yet, in this account, Socrates will still meet counterexamples. When demolishing a building, the demolition expert's skill rules the building. But clearly, the demolition expert is not considering the advantage of the building being demolished. Therefore, it seems that Socrates' altruistic conclusion does not stand anyway. 
> 
> Nevertheless, this way of reconstruction does reject the view that the art of ruling does not consider the advantage of the one who uses it, because although it does not necessarily considers only the advantage of its object, it necessarily consider only its object for the reason that it comes into being because its object needs the art. Thus, the real key argument of this part is that:
> 
> - An art comes into being when something is defective, and the art is devised for the purpose of providing what is advantageous for it.
> 
> In this sense, what is on Socrates' mind is that the ruling art comes into being because those who are ruled are defective and need a ruler to guide them. On the other hand, for Thrasymachus, the defective one is not the subject but the ruler, and the art of ruling comes into being to fulfill the ruler's desire. Thrasymachus probably did not think like that because he believes the perfect ruler cannot be defective. However, it is entirely plausible to argue that a perfect ruler is, in fact, defective, given that all human beings are defective. What Thrasymachus needs to explain is why ruling is involved in this process. While this is not strictly a philosophical question but rather an empirical one, it is not implausible, as gaining profit from another person instead of from nature is indeed most convenient, and Thrasymachus' thinking is commonsensical.  
> 
> Thus, the definition of Thrasymachus is entirely compatible with Socrates' discourse. Socrates, in turn, is not presenting any intrinsic difficulties, as he did with Cephalus and Polemarchus, but is providing an alternative understanding of ruling.

#### 2.1.4.3 The Second Definition(343a-354c)

Thrasymachus first counters Socrates by giving an example of shepherds. The shepherds consider their masters' good and their own good by fattening the sheep. Then Thrasymachus instantly turns to the second definition, namely

- justice and the just are really someone else's good, the advantage of the man who is stronger and rules, and a personal harm to the man who obeys and serves.

Then Thrasymachus quickly departs from the discourse on art, and reveals this true intention of his whole argument, which is that 

- Justice is harmful and injustice is advantageous
0.
He states that for the just person,

1. At the dissolution of the partnership, the just man does not have more than the unjust man
2. In matters pertaining to the city, the just man pays more in taxes and the unjust man pays less
3. If one holds some ruling office, the just man does not get penalties, but he also gets no advantage
4. The just person incurs the ill will of his relatives and his acquaintances when he is unwilling to serve them against what is just
5. People does not fear doing unjust deeds, but because they fear suffering them.

and for unjust person, 

1. There are in fact two types of unjust people, partially unjust men, i.e. temple robbers, kidnappers, house breakers, defrauders and thieves, and perfectly unjust people, which are tyrants.
2. The perfectly unjust person is happiest because he gets money and power without any penalties. 

Therefore, by comparison, injustice is what is profitable and advantageous.

Some scholars have suggested that Plato's dialogue "Clitophon" may function as a sort of introduction to the "Republic." This theory arises from the fact that "Clitophon" ends abruptly with Socrates asking Clitophon to explain his criticisms in more detail, and no conclusion or resolution is provided. The dialogue could be seen as setting up some of the issues that are explored in greater depth in the "Republic."
