# 1. Socrates' exhortation (407a-408b)

## 1.1 Cleitophon's mimic (407b-e)

Music and gymnastic are not sufficient for education. Those who don't care about justice is lacking in "riches".

If someone argues that 

1. unjust are unjust voluntarily, and 
2. injustice is disgraceful and hateful to the gods

then he would contradict to himself(?)

If it is possible for one to voluntarily prevail pleasure, then doing things in accordance to pleasure is involuntary.(?)

## 1.2 Cleitophon's recount (407e-408a)

- Those who exercise body neglects their souls.
- If someone does not know how to make use of something, it is better for him to relinquish it.
- If there is a compulsion to live, it is better for such a one to pass his life as a slave.


# 2. Cleitophon's question on what's next (408b-410b)

## 2.1 Asking Socrates' disciples (408b-409e)
### 2.1.1 What's the art of taking care of the soul? (409a)
If the art of taking care about the body is the art of gymnastic and medicine, then what's the art of taking care of the soul?
Justice

> Justice produce virtue, and justice is virtue?

### 2.1.2 What does justice produce? (409b)
All arts are twofold: it produce the teacher and what is taught
i.e. the art of medicine produces doctors and health.
Justice produce just men, but what does justice produce?

#### 2.1.2.1 Frist attempt: the advantageous, the needful, the beneficial, the profitable. (409c)
These all applies to other arts, but the ergon of an art should be peculiar to itself.
i.e. Carpentry declare what it is well to do, what it is fine to do, what it is needful to do, in order that implements made of wood come into being

#### 2.1.2.2 Second attempt: friendship in cities (409d)
counterexample: the friendship between human and beast

#### 2.1.2.3 Third attempt: friendship with oneness in knowledge (409e)
going back to 2.2.1: this also applies to other arts. (?)

## 2.2 Asking Socrates (410b)

### 2.2.1 What's the art of taking care of the soul?

#### 2.2.1.1 To harm enemies and benefit friends
It seems that the just man never harms anyone
Socrates fails to answer.

Conclusion: **"To a human being who has not been exhorted, you are worth everything. But that to one who has been exhorted, you are almost even a stumbling block in the way of his arriving at the goal of virtue and becoming a happy man"**
