### Requirements

- **Unofficial transcripts** of all undergraduate and graduate work may be uploaded to Panthera during the application process.

- **Note for 2023-24 academic year:** Because of the pandemic, the Department does not require GRE scores as part of the application this cycle. However, we ask applicants to submit GRE scores as part of their application if it is not a hardship to do so. If we receive an application without GRE scores, we will assume that it was a hardship for that applicant to supply scores, and we will give that application full and fair consideration in the review process, despite the absence of scores.
- **Three letters of recommendation,** preferably from academic instructors/advisors who know your academic work well. Applicants will provide the names and email addresses of the letter writers in the online application.  We do not have forms for letter writers.

- **Writing Sample** (2500 – 7000 words).
