# Book I
- Subject: whether in the civil order can there be some legitimate and sure rule of administration, taking man as they are, and the laws as they can be.
- underlying conflict: what tight permits (justice) and what interest prescribes (utility).

## Chapter One: Subject Of This First Book
What make master-slave relation legitimate?
- force and effect: compelling and revolting. The right does not come from nature but convention, then what is the convention?

## Chapter Two: Of The First Societies

- The only natural society is father-son community, which also DISSOLVES as soon as children does not need father -> originally people was equally independent.

> equality comes from the fact that people were equally independent?
 
- Family and politics: In both cases freedom is alienated for the sake of utility, of which the only difference being that family is united with parental love, but the latter not. 

- Grotius: It is false that all human power is established for the governed, for the reason that slavery can only be for the sake of the master. (Also Hobbes's argument that man tends to devour each other)
--》there needs to be a shepherd (??)
- Philo, the Emperor Caligula: A shepherd is a nature superior to his flock's, so too are the shepherds of men of a nature to their peoples'. (Also Aristotle's argument that some are born slaves and some are born masters)
- Refutation on Aristotle: A slave is a slave because he was born in slavery, which is by force not by nature.

## Chapter Three: The Right Of The Stronger

- Being a master by being strong will not last, unless he transform his force into right.

### Force does not make right (refutation on alleged right)
- Morality is not of force, while force is of necessity: therefore duty (of morality?) needs to be explained by something other than force.
- If right is alleged, it will perish as long as some is strong enough to disobey it. Thus, alleged right is obeyed by force instead of duty. Then right adds nothing to force and means nothing at all.

- illness come from god
- if seeing doctor is acceptable, then revolting things from god is acceptable.
- Power comes from god.
- $\therefore$ Revolting power from god is acceptable.

## Chapter Four: Of Slavery

- Conclusion on Chapter 3: No man possess natural power over man, and force produces no right. Therefore right doesn't come from nature but convention.

### Subject: Why would anyone alienate himself?
#### 1. Civil tranquility
- refutation: What if the despot rules worse that their own dissension would have done? Living in dungeons is also tranquil.
#### 2. Gratuitously giving oneself
- refutation: Who ever does it is not in his right mind. 
- Whoever does it could not alienate his children.  
- There must be a reason for alienation, for it is the nature of man for being free. #Q why? this is not sufficient for refuting. These are ad honem, red herring and circular argument
- It is self-contradictory that master have no obligation toward slave. #Q 郭小雨：依赖于一种关系的先在

#### 3. War
- Grotius: those who won in the war have the right to kill the vanquished, and the latter can buy back his life at the cost of freedom.
- refutation: Men are not naturally enemies ( #Q ?but they will be necessarily). Property but not man is the root of war. Individual war is neither in natural state nor in authority of laws. **If you are representing the state, you have the right to kill him but don't have the right to enslave him.** Therefore Grotius' exchange won't stand.
- war is a relationship between one State and another in which individuals, **only as soldiers**, are contingent enemies. Therefore, **any State can only have other Sates**, but not men because it is impossible to fix a true relation between things of different natures.
> How to solve the problem of motivation? Can an army fight rationally?
> And what about private war? Do private war make slaves?

## Chapter Five: That One Always Has To Go Back To A First Convention
- The man who enslaved half of the world remains nothing but **private individual** but not an association.
- people being a people is prior to they elect a king, which provides the reason why minority are obliged to submit to the choice of majority.

## Chapter Six: Of The Social Pact
- the reason for people leaving the state of nature: the obstacles prevail by their resistance.
> another possibility: man like to create new things instead of repeating. the obstacle might not be huge but boring.
### The requirement of the association
- the person is protected by the full common force, and nevertheless **obey only himself**
- **If violated**: everyone is thereupon **restored to his original rights** and resumes his natural freedom while losing the conventional freedom for which he renounced it.
> how is this possible if you have already give yourself to the contract?

### The definition of the clause:
- The **total alienation** of each associate with all of his rights to the whole community. /Each of us puts his person and his full power in common under the supreme direction of the general will; and in a body we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole.
- the condition is equal for all, thus no one has any interest in making it burdensome to the rest.
> it begins with a CLAUSE and therefore deducted equality, which is quite weird, for people usually associate without some written clause. 
> association doesn't mean the association for all. the why can't master-slave relation explained by social contract?
> It requires everyone to think like that in order to have such association.

## Chapter Seven: Of the Sovereign

### The two-fold relation
- As the member of the State toward the Sovereign, and as the member of the Sovereign toward private individuals. There hence commenced the responsibility toward a whole, which is different from assuming an obligation toward oneself.
- there can not have any kind of fundamental law that is obligatory for the body of the people in the same way a private individual contracting with himself (because he wants it). 
> (which means there is nothing absolute for the sovereign, which is the body of the people, to do)
- A Sovereign can never alienate any part of itself or subject itself to another Sovereign, for it exists because of the contract.
- State is a being of reason, which is not a man. Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be constrained to do so and **forced to be free**.

## Chapter Eight: Of the Civil State
- listening to his inclinations --> consulting reason
- stupid and bounded animal -->intelligent being and a man
- natural freedom and unlimited right --> civil freedom (limited by the general will) and property in everything he possess

## Chapter Nine: Of Real Property
- To foreigners, they can ignore possession yet they need to face the incomparably greater force of the City.
### The first occupant
- This land is not inhabited.
- One occupy only as much of it as one needs to subsist.
- One take possession of it by labor and cultivation.
> People gather together because there is no enough land, then how can the first occupant be peaceful?????

- By giving up the unlimited right, one gains property protected by the State.
- Social state is advantageous for men only insofar as all have something and none has too much of anything

# Book II

## Chapter One: That Sovereignty Is Inalienable
- There must be a common interest for a general will, or it will not last.
- The general will is not anyone's will but only an abstract will that no master should be **SIMPLY** obeyed by claiming to be general will.
> This will be explained more fully, but where?

## Chapter Two: That Sovereignty Is Indivisible
