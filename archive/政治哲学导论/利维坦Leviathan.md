# INTRODUCTION
- Nature is the **art** of God used to make and govern the world
- By the art **imitated** by man, it can make an artificial animal.
- Commonwealth, or state, in Latin Civitas, is but an artificial man, which is rational and the most excellent animal.
	- ***The sovereignty*** is an artificial ***soul*** as giving life and motion to the whole body.
	- ***The magistrates, and other officers of judicature and execution*** are artificial ***joints***.
	- ***Reward and punishment***, by which fastened to the seat of the sovereignty every joint and member is moved to perform his duty, are the ***nerves***.
	- ***The wealth and riches*** of all the particular members are the ***strength***.
	- ***Salus populi, the people's safety, its business, counsellors*** by whom all things needful for it to know are suggested unto it, are the ***memory***.
	- ***Equity and laws*** are the artificial ***reason and will***.
	- ***Concord: Health***
	- ***Sedition: Sickness***
	- ***Civil War: Death***
	- ***Pacts and covenants*** by which the parts of this body politic were at first made, set together, and united, resemble that ***fiat, or let us make man, pronounced by God in the creation***. (?)
- Wisdom is acquired not by reading in others but reading in himself.
## The Outline of Leviathan
1. The matter and the artificer, both which is man.

4. What is the kingdom of darkness.

# PART 1: OF MAN
## CHAPTER 1: OF SENSE

Concerning all thoughts of man:
- Single thought (Chapter 1-2)
- Thought depending upon one another (Chapter 3)

### Single thought: representation or appearance of an object.

#### The origin of all thoughts: sense
1. Conception either was begotten by sense, or begotten by the conception begotten by sense.

#### The cause of sense: Sensible in the object (written in elsewhere)
- The external body or object presses the organ proper to each sense and causes there a resistance which endeavor outward and made sense.
- All which qualities called sensible are in the object that causes senses.

#### Object and image are different
1. If colors and sounds were in the bodies or object that caused them, then they could not be severed from them. ( #Q: ?We do can server left hand from body) 
2. **Disapprove**: Aristotelian's view that the cause of vision is receiving visible species 

## CHAPTER 2: OF IMAGINATION

#### Imagination
- **Definition**: Imagination is **a decaying sense** made in seeing, after which the motion made in the internal parts of a man when he sees, dreams, etc. was removed, or the eye shut.
- The decay of sense is not the decay of motion made in sense, but an obscuring of it.
- Decaying sense itself is called imagination, but when we would express the decay, we call it memory. Therefore the imagination and memory are but one thing.

#### Experience
- **Definition**: Much memory or memory of many things is called experience.

#### Dream
- **Definition**: The imaginations of experience that sleep are those we call dreams.
- Dream causes superstition.
- Superstitious fear of spirits should be taken away for civil obedience.

#### Understanding
- **Definition**: The imagination that is raised in man (or any other creature indued with the faculty of imagining) by words or other voluntary signs is understanding. 

## CHAPTER 3: OF THE CONSEQUENCE OR TRAIN OF IMAGINATIONS

### Thought depending upon one another: mental discourse
- **Definition**: the succession of one thought to another which is distinguished from discourse with words.
- Unguided, without design:
