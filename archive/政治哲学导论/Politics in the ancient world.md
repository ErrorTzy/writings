## Chapter 1: State, Class and Power

### 1. Why Class Analysis? (P3-12)
There is a tradition have dichotomized class analysis on the rich and poor(P1-2)
Greece: (P3)
- party struggles
Roman: (P3-9)
- senatus consultum ultimum (P3-6)
	- Ordinarily: Questions the constitutional law (Should this exists?)
	- Finley: What does it mean by "a threat to the safety of the State"? (Why this exists?)
- The procedure of law reflected the harsh reality and failed to mitigate the difference between the rich and the poor, or not (P6-9)
	- Kaser: The corruption in the administration and the purity of law
	- Finley:
		- Ehrenburg: Oligarchy and democracy are the same because the Sovereignty was on the citizens. (P7)
		- Refute: The taxonomy that reduce states into two types (Sovereignty on one man or on citizens) is of no utility. (P8 #Q ?)
		- The government is the State. (P8)
		- The government means power. (P8-9)
		- We examine see it in the particular society (which means even though the "majority" was after all the minority, it is still majority) (P9)
#### 1.1 Why binary division? (P10)
Poor and rich means the free man labored for their livelihood verses those who depends on the labor of others. 
#### 1.2 Why putting Greece and Rome together? (P11-12)
The Greek world in late archaic period and the Roman republic are all city-state and have similar political ideal. 

### 2. How do class conflict came about? (P12-1)
#### 2.1 How do classes came about? (P12-16)
Aristocrats creditors and peasant debtors (P12)
--> Timocratical politics (The rich participate in politics) (P13-14)
--> The incorporation of peasant, craftsman and shopkeepers (The poor participate in politics) (P15-16)

#### 2.2 The control over foreign territory: Sparta, Athens and Rome ( #Q What is this part for??) (P16-18)
- Spartan citizenry: full time soldier supported by labors of foreign **helots**. (P16)
- Athens: silver mine, and then empire **revenues**. (P16-17)
- Rome: unprecedented slave labor and **population**. (P17-18)

#### 2.3 What power to enforce decisions? (How do the two classes gain force?) (P18-23)
- force can be called up by assembly (P18-20)
	- mostly the rich
	- Roman military is more strict
--> being not sufficient while expanding (P20)
- volunteer force (P20-22)
	- most citizen possess military arms as a obligation
	- cannot be command
--> The failure of political solution will result in civil war (P23)
