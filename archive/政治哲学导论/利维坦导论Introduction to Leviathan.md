# II. The Context of Leviathan

## What is political philosophy and the history of political philosophy
- The context of Leviathan can be nothing narrower than the history of political philosophy.
- **Political philosophy**'s endeavor is to explore the coherence of the world of political life and non-political life without the consciousness of any great conversion and without any sense of entering upon a new project.
- What really exists is **a single world** of ideas, which come to us divided by the abstracting force of circumstance.
- **The history of political philosophy** is the history of establishing connection between eternity and politics.
- **Political philosophers** deal in darkness because human life is a predicament and the link between politics and eternity is the deliverance of mankind
- **The civil order** appears as the whole or a part of the scheme of salvation.
- **Contingent element** like a feeling for exigencies, cares, passions of a particular time, sensitiveness to the dominant folly of an epoch is the ground and inspiration of a political philosophy.
- **What stirs the mind of Hobbes** is "grief for the present calamities of my country", a country torn between those who claimed too much for Liberty and those who claimed too much for Authority.

## What are the traditions of political philosophy
- A **masterpiece** is always the revelation of the universal predicament in the local and transitory mischief.
- There are **three traditions** of political philosophy which are
	- the one, of which *Republic* is the representative, with the master-conceptions of **Reason and Nature**
	- the one, of which *Leviathan* is the head and crown, with mater-conceptions of **Will and Artifice**, both of which came from ancient Greek, and 
	- the one, symbolled by *Philosophie des Rechts*, with master-conception of **Rational Will**, which haven't appeared until the 18th century.

## The character of Leviathan
- We may read Leviathan without drawing anything that is not there, while Leviathan is more than a tour de force, and something of its large character will be perceived if we read it with **the other works of Hobbes**.
- The character of Leviathan is its centripetal force shaped and compressed **numberless currents** of thoughts into a momentary significance.

# III. The Mind and Manner

## Understanding Hobbes as a person
- When a philosopher believes that the συνολον of form and content alone is actual, then it is good to consider the technical expression of this unity after having observed his **temperament, cast of mind and style of writing** which help us understand it, the rule of which applies to Hobbes.
- It is a riddle why Hobbes' gift were absent from his character in youth.

## The quality of Hobbes' mind
- The first impression of Hobbes is that he held a tone of **confidence in his writing**, caused by his maturity and deliberateness.
- The second impression of Hobbes is **remarkable energy** that kept him thinking actively.
- **Impulse for philosophy** may originate in **faith**(as with Erigena), or in **curiosity**(as with Locke), but with Hobbes the prime mover was **doubt**, and a radical one.
- Hobbes is a creator of a **system** without being a slave to the system.
- Hobbes loves **controversy** without repose.
- To Hobbes himself, as an independent scholar, he is quite original, though in fact he belongs to a tradition.
- Philosophy in general knows two styles, the contemplative and didactic, the first of which let us know the secret workings of their minds and such philosophy is a conversation whether or not it was written as a dialogue, while the second of which is what Hobbes' writing, the style that freed from the doubts and hesitancies, represented. (The style that full of assertions)

# IV The System

## Refutation on present view of Hobbes
- Hobbes' civil philosophy must be understood to his entire philosophy system.
- There are mainly **two views** hold the view at the present time, 
	- the first of which is the view that the foundation of Hobbes' philosophy is a doctrine of materialism, that the intention of his system was the progressive revelation of this doctrine in nature, in man and in society, and argues that the significance of **what appears at the end is determined at least in part by what was proved or assumed at the beginning**, 
	- while the second of which is the view that such attempt, **that drawing the mechanistic-materialist of politics from the mechanistic-materialist universe, is self-collapsing**.
- The two views are wrong because they expected that a philosophical system should conform to an architectural analogue, and consequently Hobbes' system is a foundation and a superstructure planned as a single whole, which in fact does violence to the system of Hobbes because the coherence of his philosophy is **not architectural but in a single "passionate thought"**, a continuous application of a doctrine about the nature of philosophy, that pervades its parts.

## Introduction of Hobbes' system
### A mirror of the world
- Hobbes' system is a mirror of reason in which the world reflected as a world of causes and effects and the two alternative ends are to determine the conditional causes of given effects or to determine the conditional effects of given causes.
- The key to understand what he means by this identification of philosophy with reasoning, there are **three contrasts**
	- the contrast between philosophy and theology (reason and faith),
	- between philosophy and science (reason and empiricism) and
	- between philosophy and experience (reason and sense)

#### Faith and philosophy
- If a world is conceived by reason, then it is only composed of things that are causes or the effects of causes. Therefore **the consideration of the universe as a whole, things infinite, thing eternal, final causes and things known only by divine grace ore revelation, which is comprehensively called as faith**, was excluded from the world of reason, not because they must not exist, but the lack of rationality. 
- **Teleology is then excluded**, for reason only concerns with what things cause ( #Q: Why?) and the internal movement comprises the impact of its parts upon one another, of attraction and repulsion, not of growth or development.
- Hobbes' philosophy is in all its parts preeminently **a philosophy of power** precisely because the mechanism philosophy elucidates the combination, transfer and resolution of forces.
- In the writing of Hobbes, philosophy and science are not contrasted eo nomie, while he has his own classification of the **genres of knowledge which distinguished a theory of knowledge itself from a knowledge of a phenomenal world**.

#### Science and philosophy
- The difference of science and philosophy is that science believes that the world is a **physical machine** based on observation and philosophy believes that the world a **rational machine** ( #C: the difference is about understanding the world from inside, as a rational being, or from outside, as a black box).

#### Experience and philosophy
- Experience is "absolute knowledge", or "knowledge of fact",( #Q: **Is there really a knowledge of absolute fact? How do we know it?**) which there is no ground upon which it can be doubted, and the categories of truth and falsehood do not apply to it, while philosophical knowledge is general and not particular, a knowledge of consequences and not of facts, and conditional and not absolute.

### Philosophy as universal knowledge
- We surmount the limit of senses and experiences by **using language to introspect**, while such effort might lead us into nominalism. Yet philosophy is not only knowledge of the universal, but a knowledge of causes.

### Philosophy as knowledge of generation
- The knowledge of causes is the knowledge of **how a thing is generated**, and the knowledge of how a thing is generated is the knowledge of philosophy because philosophy is reasoning.

### Philosophy as conditional knowledge
- There are three criteria by which a suggested cause may be judge, and proof that the cause actually operated is not among them( #Q : Then which is more real? The actual cause or the theoretical cause?).
	- For reasoning, a cause must be imaginable, and
	- the necessity of the effect must be shown to follow from the cause, and
	- it bust be shown that nothing false (that is, not present in the effect) can be derived.
- Therefore philosophy may be defined as the establishment by reasoning of true fictions ( #Q: The problem is how to fit in the second criteria? How to prove the necessity)
