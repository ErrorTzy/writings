Thi[s o](#page-13-1)perator *✷* is of great interest in a Boolean setting, partly because it can take o[ver](#page-13-1) the role of the propositional identification connective ≡ , since *✷*( ↔ ) ↔ ( ≡ ) is a theorem of Booleanism.<sup>57</sup> Booleanism implies that all ins[tan](#page-13-0)ces of the modal axioms K and T hold for *✷*. <sup>58</sup> Moreover, it would be natural for [Bo](#page-13-1)oleans to endorse further principles about embedded occurrences of ≡ which have the effect of making *✷* [be a](#page-37-0) normal modal operator obeying the logic S4, or perhaps even S5.<sup>59</sup>

[If o](#page-17-0)ne thought that *✷* had an S5 logic, it would be natural to equate [the claim](#page-17-0) that *✷*—i.e. that ≡ ⊤—with the claim that it is *metaphysically necessary* that . Some might see this as a welcome explanation of the unfamiliar (identification) in terms of the familiar (metaphysical necessity).<sup>60</sup> My attitude towards the proposed

Necessitated Ref 
$$(x \equiv_{\tau} x) \equiv T$$
  
Necessitated LL  $((A \equiv B) \rightarrow (\varphi \rightarrow [B/_{?}A]\varphi)) \equiv T$ 

Both of these are natural generalisations of *Taut*, since they assert identifications where the corresponding biconditionals were already provable in the system. Furthermore, if we accept *The Identity Identity*, we can derive these principles from the following natural analogues of Booleanism for the quantifiers:

$$\begin{split} &((\lambda v_0 \dots v_n.A) \equiv (\lambda v_0 \dots v_n.A \wedge B)) \leftrightarrow ((\lambda v_1 \dots v_n. \exists v_0(A)) \equiv (\lambda v_1 \dots v_n. \exists v_0(A) \wedge B)) \\ &((\lambda v_0 \dots v_n.A) \equiv (\lambda v_0 \dots v_n.A \vee B)) \leftrightarrow ((\lambda v_1 \dots v_n. \forall v_0(A)) \equiv (\lambda v_1 \dots v_n. \forall v_0(A) \vee B)) \end{split}$$

(Here is a formula in which <sup>0</sup> does not occur free. See Dorr 2014a and J. Goodman 2016 for more on these "Adjunction" principles.) To get to S5, on the other hand, we would have to add something much less clearly well-motivated, namely the *✷*-necessity of distinctness:

$$(x \not\equiv_{\tau} y) \to ((x \not\equiv_{\tau} y) \equiv \top)$$

For arguments that Booleans should reject this principle, see Bacon MS and J. Goodman MS.

equation, if I believed that S5 was valid for  $\Box$ , would be the reverse. Philosophers have struggled to say something helpful to single out the "metaphysical" readings of modal operators from among the panoply of other readings they may bear; their efforts have not been conspicuously successful. So an explication of 'It is metaphysically necessary that  $\varphi$ ' as 'For it to be the case that  $\varphi$  is for it to be the case that  $\top$ ' would shed some welcome light on the concept of metaphysical necessity and the interest of questions formulated in terms of it. True, as we saw in §1, 'To be F is to be G' also admits several readings; but at least it doesn't have the same array of readings as 'necessarily', and the task of singling out the target reading is perhaps less challenging. Moreover, whereas it is easy to find philosophers who claim to have no idea what metaphysical necessity is or to regard it as in some sense a defective notion, it is hard to see how any philosopher could be so dismissive of 'To be F is to be G' given the central role questions about the truth of such claims play in most branches of the subject.

'Metaphysically necessary' was introduced into the philosophical vernacular partly through general formulas—for example, the equation of metaphysical necessity with "unrestricted" or "absolute" necessity, or 'necessity in the highest degree whatever that means' (Kripke 1972, p. 99)—but partly also through philosophers exchanging opinions about which truths are, in fact, metaphysically necessary—e.g. that nothing is green and red all over, that Nixon is not an inanimate object, that a certain lectern is not made of ice, etc. If you were convinced of the falsity of claims like 'Nixon is not an inanimate object  $\equiv T$ ' or 'The lectern is not made of ice  $\equiv T$ ', etc., you might worry that the proposed interpretation of 'metaphysically necessary' would be unduly uncharitable. However given the character of 'metaphysically necessary' as a term of art, charity to the explicit explanatory remarks made by those who introduced the term should weigh especially heavily with us in deciding how to interpret it, while charity to claims that they made where they thought of themselves as taking a stand on philosophically controversial questions should count for relatively little. If we can make sense of a notion of necessity with a good claim to labels like 'necessity in the highest degree', it would be perverse to interpret 'metaphysically necessary' as expressing something more restricted just for the sake of being more charitable to the case-by-case modal pronouncements of, say, Saul Kripke.

but there are natural strategies for extending it to other types. For example, one might maintain that  $(A \equiv_{\langle \tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n \rangle} B) \equiv_{\langle \rangle} \Box \forall x_1 \ldots \forall x_n (A(x_1, \ldots, x_n)) \leftrightarrow B(x_1, \ldots, x_n))$ . Or if one rejected this on the grounds that it is inconsistent with contingentism, one might still accept  $(A \equiv_{\langle \tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n \rangle} B) \equiv_{\langle \rangle} \Box \forall x_1 \Box \ldots \forall x_n \Box (A(x_1, \ldots, x_n)) \leftrightarrow B(x_1, \ldots, x_n))$ .

This would be as misgu[ide](#page-41-0)d as interpreting philosophers like Shoemaker (1998), who maintain a doctrine that they express by saying 'All laws of nature are metaphysically necessary', as merely meaning by 'metaphysically necessary' what other philosophers have meant by 'nomically necessary'. At least if the logic of *✷* is S5, it has a very strong claim to be the "absolute" form of necessity, since whenever ≡ ⊤ is true, must be true for every other transparent operator such that ⊤ is true, a category which certainly includes all non-epistemic necessity operators.

<span id="page-41-0"></span>If the project of using identifications to say what it is to be metaphysically necessary were feasible only for S5-endorsing Booleans, that would be a weighty consideration in favour of their view. In fact, however, even if we do not question the orthodox view that the logic of metaphysical necessity is S5, this project is also open to non-Booleans, and to Booleans who reject S5 for *✷*. The question how this should go is beyond the scope of the present paper, but one obvious strategy would be to first define a higher-order predicate *is an S5 operator* (of type ⟨⟨⟨⟩⟩⟩), and then identify *being metaphysically necessary* with *being mapped to a truth by every S5 operator*, .∀⟨⟨⟩⟩(S5() → ()). <sup>62</sup> It is not obvious that this operator will turn out to itself be a S5 operator. But if this can be shown, the case for identifying it with metaphysical necessity will be parallel to the case for identifying . ≡ ⊤ with metaphysical necessity if its logic is S5. Thus, while it does seem like an advantage of a theory if it allows for a plausible explanation of metaphysical necessity in terms of identifications, this advantage is not distinctive to Booleanism. The [fea](#page-93-0)ture that does seem to be distinctive to Booleanism is the possibility of explaining identifications in terms of metaphysical necessity; but the ability to do this does not seem to me to be much of an advantage at all.

$$Taut(x) =_{df} (\lambda q.q \lor \neg q) \le (\lambda q.x(q \lor \neg q))$$

$$K(x) =_{df} \lambda pq.(xp \land p \le q) \le (\lambda pq.xq)$$

$$T(x) =_{df} x \le (\lambda q.q)$$

$$B(x) =_{df} (\lambda q.q) \le (\lambda q.x(\neg x(\neg q)))$$

Here, ≤⟨⟨⟩⟩ can in turn be defined as ≡⟨⟨⟩⟩ .(() ∧ ()). Non-Booleans could adopt the same strategy but with a different definition of ≤. One possible definition that is well behaved in a wide variety of non-Boolean settings, including the models considered in the Appendix, is ≤⟨⟨⟩⟩ =df (.() ∧ (() ∧ ())) ≡⟨⟨⟩⟩ (.() ∨ (() ∧ ())) (see Appendix A8).

<sup>57</sup>*Proof:* Suppose ≡ . ( ↔ ) ≡ ( ↔ ) is true by Ref and LL; ⊤ ≡ ( ↔ ) is true by *Taut*, so ( ↔ ) ≡ ⊤ is true by LL. In the other direction, suppose ( [↔](#page-99-0) ) ≡ ⊤. ≡ ( [↔ \(](#page-99-1) ↔ )) is true by *Taut*, so by LL, ≡ ( ↔ ⊤); also ( ↔ ⊤) ≡ by *Taut*, so ≡ by LL.

<sup>58</sup>For K, suppose that → ≡ ⊤ and ≡ ⊤; then (⊤ → ) ≡ ⊤ by LL; since (⊤ → ) ≡ by *Taut*, a second application of LL yields ≡ ⊤. For T, suppose that ≡ ⊤; ⊤ is true by propositional logic, so we can infer by LL.
