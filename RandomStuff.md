The way I've framed the question, i.e. how much reality we should read off our linguistic features, is a bit different from the standard story told in metametaphysics. I think the standard narrative, which I'll lay out in a moment, tends to miss something important. I take the familiar story told by ==Schaffer (2009)==, probably the most-cited paper in the field, as the orthodox version (though I'll be telling a bit differently).
