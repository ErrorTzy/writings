1.  Explain why the following is true: Leibniz’s Law requires Locke to deny the intuitive principle “Two things cannot occupy exactly the same place at the same time.”   On the other hand, this principle can be held by mereological essentialists like Butler and Reid. 

Consider one tree over two time periods: 

- At time $t_1$: The tree has one branch 
- Between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$: The branch was chopped off
- At time $t_2$: The tree has no branch

Let's define "trook" as the mass that remains after removing a branch from a tree (trunk, roots, etc.). Let Trookrepresent the trook at t₁. Assume the only change to the tree is the removal of the branch.

1. $Tree_{1} \neq Trook_{1}$, because $Trook_{1}$ does not have a branch, while $Tree_{1}$ has.
2. $Tree_{2} = Trook_{2}$, because $Tree_{2}$ and $Trook_{2}$ are composed of the same matter
3. $Tree_{1} = Tree_{2}$, because there is sufficient continuity so that the tree has identity over time.
4. $Trook_{1} = Trook_{2}$, because no change has taken place over time.
5. $Tree_{1} = Trook_{1}$, because according to 2,3,4, $Tree_{1}=Tree_{2}=Trook_{2}=Trook_{1}$

Since 1 and 5 contradicts with each other, there must be at least one line that goes wrong. 1 is true because of the Leibniz law. And since there is no reason to deny the transitivity of identity, the conjunction of 2,3 and 4 would entail 5. Therefore the problem must exist among 2,3,4
