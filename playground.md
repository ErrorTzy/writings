Desire has to specify content: to prevent negative feeling is not sufficient for the case like "the desire for sex/breathing"; The desire to eat is not equivalent to feeling hunger. The feeling when you have when you are voluntarily holding breath seems different from the desire to breath (?or is it just the difference in degree? Or should we even say we have a desire for breathing, or it is just a automatic action? But we are **able** to notice our breathe. It is not like digestion or heartbeat, which we cannot notice... Or we hardly notice? We may in some cases notice our heartbeat. But what we notice is not the desire of heartbeat, but just the inner tactile feeling of heartbeat.)
