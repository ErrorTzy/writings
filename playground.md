1.  Explain why the following is true: Leibniz’s Law requires Locke to deny the intuitive principle “Two things cannot occupy exactly the same place at the same time.”   On the other hand, this principle can be held by mereological essentialists like Butler and Reid. 

Consider one tree over two time periods: 

- At time $t_1$: The tree has a trunk and a branch 
- Between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$: The branch was chopped off
- At time $t_2$: The tree has only its trunk[^1]

1. $Tree_{1} \neq Trunk_{1}$, because $Trunk_{1}$ does not have a branch, while $Tree_{1}$ has. According to 
2. $Tree_{2} = Trunk_{2}$, because $Tree_{2}$ and $Trunk_{2}$ are composed of the same matter
3. $Tree_{1} = Tree_{2}$, because there is sufficient continuity so that the tree has identity over time.
4. $Trunk_{1} = Trunk_{2}$, because there is perfect continuity so that the trunk has identity over time.
5. $Tree_{1} = Trunk_{1}$, because according to 2,3,4, $Tree_{1}=Tree_{2}=Trunk_{2}=Trunk_{1}$

Since 1 and 5 contradicts with each other, there must be at least one line that goes wrong. 

[^1]: Since in fact a tree has roots, we can let "trunk" here mean "root and trunk and whatever is left of a tree when its branch is chopped off".
